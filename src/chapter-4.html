	I. The Last Foolish Journey
</h2>

<p>
	The Bible says you should go <em>with</em> a brother twice as far as he asks.
	It certainly <em>does not</em> suggest that you set him <em>back</em> on his
	journey. Devotion to a brother <em>cannot</em> set <em>you</em> back either.
	It can <em>only</em> lead to mutual progress. The result of genuine devotion
	is inspiration, a word which, properly understood, is the <em>opposite</em> of
	fatigue. To be fatigued is to be <em>dis</em>pirited, but to be inspired is to
	be <em>in</em> the spirit. To be egocentric <em>is</em> to be dispirited, but
	to be self-centred in the <em>right</em> sense is to be inspired, or in the
	spirit. The truly inspired are enlightened and cannot abide in darkness.
</p>

<p>
	Do not attempt to break God’s copyright, because His authorship alone
	<em>can</em> ‘copy right’. Your own right authorship does <em>not</em> lie in
	remaking His copies, but in creating <em>like</em> Him.
</p>

<p>
	Embarrassment is always an expression of egocentricity, an association which
	has been made before. If you complete the sentence stem “When I was called on
	to speak” with “I became embarrassed and <em>could not speak</em>”, this
	should be corrected to “I recognised my authorship”. You cannot be embarrassed
	by your own words unless you believe that you are responsible for them. 4We
	have already corrected ‘word’ to ‘thought’, and you <em>are</em> free to
	allocate the authorship of your thoughts as you elect. You can thus speak from
	your spirit or from your ego, precisely as you choose. If you speak from your
	spirit, you have chosen to “Be still, and know that <em>I</em> am God”. These
	words are inspired, because they come from <em>knowledge</em>. If you speak
	from your ego, you are <em>disclaiming</em> knowledge instead of
	<em>affirming</em> it, and are thus dispiriting yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The dispirited have no choice <em>but</em> to be narcissistic, and to be
	narcissistic <em>is</em> to place your faith in the unworthy. Your real worth
	is your divine authorship, and your spirit is its acknowledgment. I cannot
	guide your mind <em>except</em> as you associate it with your spirit.
</p>

<p>
	Attacking misidentification errors is neither <em>my</em> function nor
	<em>yours</em>. Destroying the devil is a meaningless undertaking. Cervantes
	wrote an excellent symbolic account of this procedure, though he did not
	understand his own symbolism. The <em>real</em> point of his writing was that
	his hero was a man who perceived himself as unworthy because he identified
	with his ego and perceived its weakness. He then set about to alter this
	misperception, <em>not</em> by correcting his misidentification, but by
	behaving egotistically.
</p>

<p>
	Chesterton wrote an excellent description of Cervantes and his perception of
	his ‘unheroic hero’, a view of human beings which the ego tolerates all too
	frequently but which the spirit <em>never</em> countenances:
</p>

<blockquote>
	And he sees across a weary land a straggling road in Spain,<br />
	Up which a lean and foolish knight forever rides in vain.
</blockquote>

<p>
	Do not embark on foolish journeys, because they are indeed in vain. The ego
	may will them because the ego <em>is</em> both lean and foolish, but the
	spirit <em>cannot</em> embark on them because it is forever <em>un</em>willing
	to depart from its foundation. The journey to the cross should be the
	<em>last</em> foolish journey for every mind. Do not dwell upon it, but
	dismiss it as accomplished. If you can accept that as <em>your own</em> last
	foolish journey, you are free also to join my resurrection.
</p>

<p>
	Human living has indeed been needlessly wasted in repetition compulsion. It
	reënacts the separation, the loss of power, the foolish journey of the ego in
	its attempts at reparation, and finally the crucifixion of the body, or death.
	Repetition compulsions can be endless, unless they are given up by an act of
	will or, more properly, an active creation. Do not make the pathetic human
	error of ‘clinging to the old rugged cross’. The only message of the
	crucifixion is in respect to your ability to <em>overcome</em> the cross.
	Unless you do so, you are free to crucify yourself as often as you choose. But
	this was <em>not</em> the gospel I intended to offer you. We have another
	journey to undertake, and I hope that, if you will read these teachings
	carefully, they will help to prepare you to undertake it.
</p>

	II. The Devoted Teacher
</h2>

<p>
	We have spoken of many different human symptoms, and at this level there
	<em>is</em> almost endless variation. But there is only one cause for all of
	them. The authority problem, not money, <em>is</em> the real ‘root of all
	evil’. Money is but one of its many reflections, and is a reasonably
	representative example of the kind of thinking which stems from it. The idea
	of buying and selling implies precisely the kind of exchange that the spirit
	cannot understand at all, because its own supply is always abundant and all
	its demands are fully met.
</p>

<p>
	Every symptom which the ego has made involves a contradiction in terms. This
	is because the mind is split between the ego and the spirit, so that
	<em>whatever</em> the ego makes is incomplete and contradictory. Consider, for
	example, what a ‘speechless professor’ means as a concept. It literally means
	a ‘non-professing professor’ or a ‘non-speaking speaker’. Untenable positions
	such as this are the result of the authority problem, which, because it
	accepts the one inconceivable thought as its premise, can only produce ideas
	which are inconceivable.
