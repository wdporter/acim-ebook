<h2>I. The Real Meaning of Possession</h2>

<p>The real meaning of possession should be clarified.
  Fear of possession is a perverted expression of the fear of the irresistible attraction of God.
  The truth is still that the attraction of God is irresistible at <i>all</i> levels, and the acceptance of this totally
  unavoidable truth is only a matter of time.
  But you should consider whether you <i>want</i> to wait, because you <i>can</i> return now, if you choose.</p>

<p>Possession is a concept which has been subject to numerous distortions, some of which we will list below:</p>

<p><b>Type 1:</b> Possession can be associated with the body only.
  If this occurs, sex is particularly likely to be contaminated.
  Possession versus being possessed is apt to be seen as the male versus the female role.
  Since neither will be conceived of as satisfying alone, and both will be associated with fear, this interpretation is
  particularly vulnerable to psychosexual confusion.</p>

<p><b>Type 2:</b> From a rather similar reference point, possession can also be associated with things.
  This is essentially a shift type 1 and is usually due to an underlying fear of associating possession with people.
  In this sense, it is an attempt to <i>protect</i> people from one’s possessiveness, like the superstition about
  ‘protecting the name’ we mentioned before.</p>

<p>Both type 1 and type 2 are likely to become compulsive for several reasons, including:
  <ol class="alpha">
    <li>They represent an attempt to escape from the real possession drive, which cannot be satisfied this way.</li>
    <li>They set up substitute goals, which are usually reasonably easy to attain.</li>
    <li>They <i>appear</i> to be relatively harmless, and thus <i>seem</i> to allay fear.
    The fact that they usually interfere with good interpersonal relationships can be interpreted, in this culture, as a lack of sophistication on the part of the <i>other</i> (not the self), and this induces a false feeling of confidence in the solution.
    It is also fairly easy to find a partner who <i>shares</i> the illusion.
    Thus, we have any number of relationships which are actually <i>established</i> on the basis of type 1, <i>hold together</i> primarily because of the joint interests in type 2.</li>
    <li>The manifestly <i>external</i> emphasis which both entail seems to be a safety device, and thus permits a false escape from much more basic inhibitions.
    As a compromise solution, the <i>illusion</i> of interpersonal relating is preserved, along with the retention of lack of love.
    This kind of psychic juggling leaves the juggler with a feeling of emptiness, which in fact is perfectly justified, because he <i>is</i> acting from scarcity.
    He then becomes more and more driven in his behaviour, to fill the emptiness.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>When these solutions have been invested with extreme belief, type 1 leads to sex crimes and type 2 to stealing.
  The kleptomaniac is a good example of the latter.</p>

<p>
  Generally, three types of emotional disturbances result:
  <ol class="alpha">
    <li>The tendency to maintain the illusion that only the physical is real.
    This produces depression.</li>
    <li>The tendency to invest the physical with non-physical properties.
    This is essentially magic and tends more toward anxiety-proneness.</li>
    <li>The tendency to vacillate from one to the other, which produces a corresponding vacillation between depression and anxiety.</li>
  </ol>
  All three result in self imposed starvation.
</p>

<p><b>Type 3.</b> Another type of distortion is seen in the fear of or desire for ‘spirit’ possession.
The term ‘spirit’ is profoundly debased in this context, but it <i>does</i> entail a recognition that the body is not enough and investing it with magic will not work. 
This recognition <i>accepts</i> the fact that neither type 1 nor type 2 is sufficient, but precisely because it does not limit fear so narrowly, it is more likely to produce greater fear in its own right.</p>

<p>Endowing the Spirit with human possessiveness is a more <i>inclusive</i> error than type 1 or type 2, and a step somewhat further away from the right mind. 
Projection is also more likely to occur, with vacillations between grandiosity and fear. 
‘Religion’, in a distorted sense, is also more likely to occur in this kind of error, because the idea of a ‘spirit’ is introduced, though fallaciously, while it is excluded from type 1 and type 2.
Witchcraft is thus particularly apt to be associated with type 3, because of the much greater investment in magic.</p>

<p>It should be noted that type 1 involves only the body, and type 2 involves an attempt to associate things with human attributes. 
Type 3, on the other hand, is a more serious level confusion, because it endows the Spirit with <i>evil</i> attributes. 
This accounts both for the religious zeal of its proponents and the aversion (or fear) of its opponents. 
Both attitudes stem from the same false belief.</p>

<p>This is <i>not</i> what the Bible means by ‘filled with the Holy Spirit’. 
The concept of ‘speaking in many tongues’ was originally an injunction to communicate to everyone in his own language, or at his own level. 
It hardly meant to speak in a way that <i>nobody</i> could understand.</p>

<p>This strange error occurs when people <i>do</i> understand the need for universal communication, but have contaminated it with the possession fallacy. 
The fear engendered by this misperception leads to a conflicted state in which communication <i>is</i> attempted, but the fear is allayed by making the communication incomprehensible. 
It could also be said that the fear induces selfishness or regression, because incomprehensible communication is hardly a worthy offering from one Son of God to another.</p>

<p><b>Type 4:</b> Knowledge can also be misinterpreted as a means of possession. 
Here, the content is not physical, and the underlying fallacy is more likely to be the confusion of mind and brain. 
The attempt to unite nonphysical content with physical attributes is illustrated by statements like ‘the thirst for knowledge’. 
This is <i>not</i> what ‘thirst’ in the Bible means. 
The term was used only because of humanity’s limited comprehension and is probably better dropped.</p>

<p>
  The fallacious use of knowledge can result in several errors, including:
  <ol class="alpha"> 
    <li>The idea that knowledge will make the individual more attractive to others. 
    This is a possession-fallacy.</li>
    <li>The idea that knowledge will make the individual invulnerable. 
    This is a reäction formation against the underlying fear of vulnerability.</li> 
    <li>The idea that knowledge will make the individual worthy. 
    This is largely pathetic.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>Like all these fallacies, type 4 contains a denial mechanism, which swings into operation as the fear increases, thus cancelling out the error temporarily but seriously impairing efficiency.
For example, one person might claim he cannot read, while another might claim he cannot speak.</p>

<p>
  Note that depression is a real risk here, for a child of God should never <i>reduce</i> his efficiency in <i>any</i> way. 
  The depression comes from a peculiar pseudo-solution which reads:
  <blockquote class="em">
    A child of God is efficient.<br /> 
    I am not efficient.<br /> 
    Therefore, I am not a Child of God.
  </blockquote>
  This leads to neurotic resignation, and this is a state which merely <i>increases</i> the depression.
</p>

<p>The corresponding denial mechanism for type 1 is the sense of <i>physical</i> inability, or <i>impotence</i>. 
The denial mechanism for type 2 is often bankruptcy. 
Collectors of things often drive themselves well beyond their financial means, in an attempt to force discontinuance. 
If this idea of cessation cannot be tolerated, a strange compromise involving <i>both</i> insatiable possessiveness and insatiable throwing away may result.</p>

<p>An example is the inveterate or compulsive gambler, particularly the horse-racing addict. 
Here, the conflicted drive is displaced both from people <i>and</i> things, and is invested in animals. 
The implied <i>derogation</i> of people is the cause of the underlying <i>extreme</i> superstition of the horse racing addict. 
The alcoholic is in a similar position, except that his hostility is more inward than outward directed. 
Defences aimed at protecting (or retaining) error are particularly hard to undo, because they introduce second-order misperceptions which obscure the underlying errors still further.</p>

<p>
  The pseudo-corrective mechanism for type 3 is apt to be more varied because of the more inclusive nature of the error, which has already been mentioned. 
  Some of the possibilities are listed below:
  <ol class="alpha">
    <li>One aspect of the possession/possessed conflict can be raised to predominance. 
    If this is attempted in connection with <i>possessing</i>, it leads to the paranoid solution. 
    The underlying component of ‘being possessed’ is retained in the ‘persecution’ fantasies which generally accompany the paranoia.</li>
    <li>If ‘being possessed’ is brought to ascendance, a state of some sort of possession by external forces results, but <i>not</i> with a major emphasis on attacking others. 
    Attack <i>by</i> others becomes the more obvious component. 
    In the more virulent forms, there is a sense of being possessed by demons, and unless this vacillates with (a), a catatonic solution is more likely than a paranoid one. 
    The <i>focussed</i> paranoid has become more rigid in his solution and centres on <i>one</i> source of projection to escape from vacillation. 
    It should be noted that this type of paranoia is an upside-down form of religion, because of its obvious attempt to unify into oneness.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>Types 1, 2 and 4 are more likely to produce neurotic rather than psychotic states, though this is by no means guaranteed. 
However, type 3 is inherently more vulnerable to psychosis, again because of the more fundamental level confusion which is involved.
It should be noted that the greater fear which is induced by type 3 can <i>itself</i> reach psychotic proportions, thus forcing the individual closer and closer to a psychotic solution.</p>

<p>It is emphasized here that these differences have no effect at all on the miracle, which can heal any of them with equal ease. 
This is because of the miracle’s inherent avoidance of within-error distinctions. 
Its <i>sole</i> concern is to distinguish between truth on the one hand and <i>all</i> kinds of error on the other. 
This is why some miracles <i>seem</i> to be of greater magnitude than others. 
But remember the first principle in this course: that there is no order of difficulty in miracles.</p>

<p>The emphasis on mental illness, which is marked in these notes, reflects the <i>undoing</i> aspect of the miracle. 
The <i>doing</i> aspect is, of course, much more important. 
But a true miracle cannot occur on a false basis. 
Sometimes the undoing must precede it. 
At other times, both can occur simultaneously, but you are not up to this at the moment.</p>

<p>Further, insights into mental illness can be misused and lead to preöccupation with one’s own symptoms. 
This is why this area is less constructive for most people than a course primarily devoted to mental health. 
However, some professions will find some principles of mental illness constructive, especially those which are concerned with mental illness in others. 
This obviously includes psychologists.</p>

<p>The obvious correction for <i>all</i> types of the possession fallacy is to redefine possession correctly. 
In the sense of ‘taking over’, the concept does not exist at all in divine reality, which is the only level of reality where real existence is a meaningful term. 
No one <i>can</i> be ‘taken over’ unless he wills to be. 
However, if he places his mind under tyranny rather than authority (see previous reference), he intrudes the concept of submission/dominance onto free will himself. 
This produces the obvious contradiction inherent in any formulation which associates free will with imprisonment.</p>

<p>Even in very mild forms, this kind of association is risky, and may spread quite unexpectedly, particularly under external stress. 
This is because it can be internally controlled <i>only</i> if <i>external</i> conditions are peaceful. 
This is not safe, because external conditions are produced by the thoughts of many, not all of whom are pure in heart as yet. 
Why should you be at <i>their</i> mercy? 
This issue is <i>very</i> closely related to the whole possession issue. 
You are thinking that people <i>can</i> possess you if you believe that their thoughts (or 
the external environment) can affect you, regardless of <i>what</i> they think.</p>

<p>You are perfectly unaffected by <i>all</i> expressions of lack of love. 
These can be either from yourself and others, or from yourself to others, or from others to you. 
Peace is an attribute in <i>you</i>. 
You cannot find it outside. 
All mental illness is some form of <i>external</i> searching. 
Mental health is <i>inner</i> peace. 
It enables you to remain unshaken by lack of love from without, and capable, through your own miracles, of correcting the external conditions which proceed from lack of love in others.</p>

<h2>II. The Cause of the Separation</h2>

<p>
  This section deals with a more fundamental misuse of knowledge, referred to in the Bible as the cause of the fall (or separation). 
  There are several introductory remarks which are intended to make these explanations less fear provoking. 
  First, I draw your attention to a couplet from Shakespeare’s <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>: 
  <blockquote>
    Be as thou wast wont to be;<br /> 
    See as thou wast wont to see.
  </blockquote>
  These words were said by Oberon in releasing Titania from her own errors, both of being and perceiving. 
  These were the words which reëstablished her true identity as well as her true abilities and judgement. 
  The similarity to your release is obvious.
</p>

<p>
  There are also some dictionary definitions which will be helpful. 
  Their somewhat unusual nature is due to the fact that they are not usually the first definitions listed. 
  Nevertheless, the fact that each of them does appear in the dictionary should be reässuring. 
  <blockquote>
    project (verb): to extend forward or out <br />
    project (noun): a plan in the mind <br />
    world: a natural grand division
  </blockquote>
</p>

<p>We will refer later to projection as related to both mental illness and mental health. 
It has also be commented on that Lucifer literally projected himself from Heaven. 
We also have observed that you can make an empty shell, but cannot make nothing at all. 
This emptiness provides the screen for the misuse of projection.</p>

<p>The Garden of Eden, which is described as a literal garden in the Bible, was not originally an actual garden at all. 
It was merely a mental state of complete need-lack. 
Even in the literal account, it is noteworthy that the pre-separation state was essentially one in 
which man needed nothing. 
The tree of knowledge, again an overly literal concept (as is clearly shown by the subsequent reference to ‘eating of the fruit of the tree‘), is a symbolic reference to some of the misuses of knowledge referred to in the section immediately preceding this one. 
There is, however, considerable clarification of this concept which must be understood before the real meaning of the ‘detour into fear’ can be fully comprehended.</p>

<p>Projection, as defined above (this refers to the verb), is a fundamental attribute of God, which He also gave to His Son. 
In the creation, God projected his creative ability out of Himself toward the Son [souls] whom He created, and also imbued them with the same loving will to create. 
We have commented before on the <i>fundamental</i> error involved in confusing what has been created with what is being made. 
We have also emphasised that you have not only been fully Created, but also been created perfect. 
There is no emptiness in you. 
The next point, too, has already been made, but bears repetition here: The Son [soul], because of its own likeness to his Creator, is creative . 
No child of God is capable of losing this ability, because it is inherent in what he <i>is</i>.</p>
