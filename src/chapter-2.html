<p> The real meaning of possession should be clarified. 
Fear of possession is a perverted expression of the fear of the irresistible attraction of God. 
The truth is still that the attraction of God is irresistible at <i>all</i> levels, and the acceptance of this totally unavoidable truth is only a matter of time. 
But you should consider whether you <i>want</i> to wait, because you <i>can</i> return now, if you choose.</p>

<p> Possession is a concept which has been subject to numerous distortions, some of which we will list below:</p>

<p> <b>Type 1:</b> Possession can be associated with the body only. 
If this occurs, sex is particularly likely to be contaminated. 
Possession versus being possessed is apt to be seen as the male versus the female role. 
Since neither will be conceived of as satisfying alone, and both will be associated with fear, this interpretation is particularly vulnerable to psychosexual confusion.</p>
