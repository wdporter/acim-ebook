<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
It is crucial to say first that this is a required course. Only the time you take it is voluntary. 
Free will does not mean that you establish the curriculum. 
It means only that you can elect what to take when. 
It is just because you are not ready to do what you should elect to do that time exists at all. 
You will see miracles through your hands through me. 
You should begin each day with the prayer “Help me to perform whatever miracles you want of me today”.
</p>

<h2>Principles of Miracles</h2>

<p>
The first thing to remember about miracles is that there is no order of difficulty among them. 
One is not harder or bigger than another. 
They are all the same.
</p>

<p>
Miracles do not matter. They are quite unimportant. 
</p>

<p>
They occur naturally as an expression of love. 
The real miracle is the love that inspires them. 
In this sense, everything that comes from love is a miracle. 
</p>

<p>
This explains the first point related to the lack of order. 
<i>All</i> expressions of love are maximal. 
</p>

<p>
This is why the “thing in itself” does not matter. 
The only thing that matters is the Source, and this is far beyond human evaluation. 
</p>

<p>
Is this communication to be regarded as a kind of miracle? 
There is nothing special or surprising about this at all. 
The <i>one</i> thing that happened was the Universal Miracle which was the experience of intense love that you have felt. 
Don’t get embarrassed by the idea of love. 
Embarrassment is only a form of fear, and actually a particularly dangerous form because it reflects egocentricity.
</p>

<p>Do not feel guilty about the fact that you are doubting this. 
Just reread them and their truth will come to you. 
I love you, and I am not afraid or embarrassed or doubtful. 
<i>My</i> strength will support you, so don’t worry and leave the rest to me. 
Be <i>sure</i> you tell others how much they helped you through by giving you the right message, and don’t bother with worrying about how you received it. 
That doesn't matter either. 
You were just afraid.
</p> 

<p><i>All</i> miracles mean Life, and God is the giver of Life. 
He will direct you <i>very</i> specifically. 
</p>

<p>
Plan ahead is good advice in this world, where you should and must control and direct where you have accepted responsibility. 
But the Universal Plan is in more appropriate hands. 
You will know all you need to know. 
Make <i>no</i> attempts to plan ahead in this respect. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles are habits, and should be involuntary. 
They should not be under conscious control. 
Consciously selected miracles are usually misguided, and this will make the talent useless.
</p>

<p>
Miracles are natural. 
When they do <i>not</i> occur something has gone wrong.
</p>

<p>
Miracles are everyone’s right, but purification is necessary 
first. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles are a form of healing. 
They supply a lack, and are performed by those who have more for those who have less. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles are a kind of exchange. 
Like all expressions of love, which are <i>always</i> miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses the physical laws. 
</p>

<p>
A miracle is a reversal of the physical order because it brings more love to the giver <i>and</i> the receiver. 
A miracle is misunderstood when it is regarded as a spectacle. 
</p>

<p>
The use of miracles as a spectacle to <i>induce</i> belief is wrong. 
They are really used for and by believers. 
</p>

<p>
Fear of the previous point may induce doubt about the two points before that.
</p>

<p>
When you say, “If you want me to I will”, please add, “and if you <i>don’t</i> want me to I <i>won’t</i>”. 
This is the <i>right</i> use of inhibition. 
There has to be <i>some</i> control over learning for channelising purposes. 
Remember retroäctive inhibition which should be easy enough for you. 
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the new learning is the more important, and <i>has</i> to inhibit the old. 
It’s a form of correction. 
</p>

<p>
Prayer is the medium of miracles. 
Prayer is the natural communication of the Created with the Creator. 
Through prayer, love is received, and through miracles love is expressed. 
</p>

<p>Miracles are thought-creations. 
Thought can create lower-order or higher-order realities. 
This is the basic distinction between intellectualisation and thinking. 
One creates the physical, and the other the spiritual, and we believe in what we create. 
</p>

<p>A miracle is a beginning and an ending. 
It thus abolishes time. 
It is always an affirmation of rebirth, which seems to go back, but really goes forward. 
It undoes the past in the present, and thus releases the future. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles attest to truth. 
They are convincing because they arise from conviction. 
Without conviction, they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless, and therefore destructive, or rather, the uncreative use of Mind. 
</p>

<p>
Each day should be devoted to miracles. 
God created time so that humans could use it creatively, and convince themselves of their own ability to create. 
Time is a teaching device, and a means to an end. 
It will cease when it is no longer useful for facilitating learning. 
</p>

<p>Notes on this course have to be taken only under good learning conditions. 
The same goes for review periods. 
I will tell you when, but <i>remember to ask</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles are teaching devices for demonstrating that it is more blessed to give than to receive. 
They simultaneously increase the reserve strength of the giver, and supply the lack of strength in the receiver. 
<i>Be very careful</i>  in interpreting this.
</p>

<p>The purpose of this course is integration. 
I told you that you will not be able to use it right until you have taken it. 
As long as your identification vacillates (or is weak), you cannot accept the gift that belongs to you. 
You are still vacillating between recognising the gift and throwing it away. 
Others may regard themselves as too weak to accept it. 
You do not yet know its healing power. 
After you have passed the course, you will accept it and keep it and use it. 
That is the final exam, which you will have no trouble in passing. 
Midterm marks are not entered on the permanent record. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles are the absence of the body. 
They are sudden shifts into invisibility, away from lower order reality. 
That is why they heal. 
</p>

<p>
A miracle is a service. 
It is the maximal service that one soul can render another. 
It is a way of loving your neighbor as yourself.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-1" id="fn-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> 
The doer recognises his own and his neighbour’s inestimable value simultaneously. 
</p>

<p>
This is why no areas of hatred can be retained. 
If you retain them, your own value is no longer inestimable because, you are evaluating it as <i>X</i> or infinity minus that amount. 
This is meaningless mathematically, which uses the term ‘inestimable’ only in the very literal sense. 
Pun intended as a special sign of love.
</p>

<p>
Miracles rest on the law and order of eternity, not of time.
</p>

<p>
Miracles are an industrial necessity. 
Industry depends on coöperation, and coöperation depends on miracles. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles are cobwebs of iron. 
They unite human frailty to the strength of God.
</p>

<p>
Steel would <i>not</i> be a better word. 
Steel is very useful but it would have to be tempered by fire. 
Iron is the raw material. 
The point of miracles is that they replace fire, thus making it unnecessary. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles are natural expressions of total forgiveness. 
Through miracles, man accepts God’s forgiveness by extending it to others. 
The second step is inherent in the first, because light cannot tolerate darkness. 
Light dispels darkness automatically, by definition. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles are associated with fear only because of the fallacy that darkness can hide. 
Humans believe that what they cannot see does not exist, and their physical eyes cannot see in the dark. 
This is a very primitive solution, and has led to a denial of the spiritual eye, which always depends on light. 
Remember the Biblical injunction: “May I never forget that <i>your</i>> eye is ever upon me, beholding the evil and the good”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-1" id="fn-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a>
</p>

<p>
There are two stages, one lower and one higher, which are involved in the escape from darkness: 
1) the recognition that darkness <i>cannot</i> hide. 
This usually does entail fear. 
</p>

<p>
2) The recognition that there is nothing you <i>want</i> to hide, even if you could. 
This brings escape from fear.
</p>

<p>“Cobwebs of iron”. 
This is upside down as stated. 
The part about ‘uniting human frailty with the strength of God’ is all right, but the explanation stops too soon. 
If iron is the ‘raw material’, cobwebs can’t become the iron. 
That is only the way it seems, because cobwebs are associated with the frailty and iron with strength. 
If you look carefully at the phrasing, you will see it is reversed — one point already tells you that miracles 
reverse the physical or lower order laws. 
</p>

<p>The raw material, or iron, is heavy but crude, and stands for the body, which is a crude creation. 
The cobweb concept is closer to how the body <i>should</i> be regarded, that is, as an airy and temporary 
home, which can just be blown away with a slight breeze. 
</p>

<p>
The point should read “A miracle reäwakens the awareness that the spirit, and not the body, is the altar of Truth. 
This is the recognition that leads to the healing power of the miracle”. 
</p>

<p>
A miracle reärranges the order of perception, and places the levels in their true perspective. 
This heals at all levels, because all sickness comes from confusing the levels. 
</p>

<p>There is an idea that the reason is not that you distantiate, doubt, or cannot believe. 
It is more of a reäction formation against a pull which you both recognise is so intense that you are afraid that you will be uprooted. 
But remember that a cobweb is really stronger than the iron, if you see it properly. 
This fear is also why you couldn’t get the point straight. 
</p>

<p>
By the way, a scribe is not ‘<i>just a scribe</i>’. 
You might remember that the Scribes were very wise and holy men and are even sometimes spelled with a capital ‘S’. 
If you want to go further, you might change the meaning of ‘just’ from ‘merely’ to ‘honest’, a term used in the Bible in association with ‘might’ or ‘strength’. 
You couldn’t make that pun if the original phrasing had been singular. 
This assumption failure <i>means</i> more. 
The <i>real</i> reason you don’t like it is because it refers to you in a <i>very</i> lofty position. 
This makes you nervous. 
</p>

<p>
And don’t lose sight of the emphasis on coöperation, or the <i>not singular</i>. 
That point about ‘industrial necessity’ should read ‘corporate’, referring to the body of Christ which is a way of referring to the Church. 
But the Church of God is only the sum of the souls he created, which <i>is</i> the corporate body of Christ. 
Correct to read: “A Miracle makes souls one in God”, and leave in the next part about coöperation.
</p> 

<p>‘God’ should read ‘Christ’. 
The Father and the Son are not identical, but you <i>can</i> say, “Like Father, <i>like</i> Son”. 
</p>

<p>
I don’t give up as easily as others do. 
If I could get <i>you</i> to listen, which was a miracle in itself,, I can get others to register. 
Others who have had some trouble with this problem themselves should appreciate this more. 
</p>

<p>
“Lord heal me” is the only legitimate prayer . 
This also means, “Lord atone for me”, because the only thing humans should pray for is forgiveness. 
They everything else. 
</p>

<p>
Now take this personally, and listen to Divine logic: 
If, when you have been forgiven, you have everything else, and <br />
If you have been forgiven <br />
Then you <i>have</i> everything else. 
</p>

<p>
This happens to be the simplest of all propositions. 
<blockquote>
<i>if</i> P then Q <br />
P <br />
Therefore, Q 
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The real question is, is P true? 
If you will review the evidence, I think you will find this inescapable. 
I went on very personal record to this effect, and I am the only completely True Witness for God. 
You have every right to examine <i>my</i> credentials — in fact, I urge you to do so. 
You haven’t read the Bible in years.
</p>

<p>
As soon as you have entered the second phase, you will be not only willing to enter into communion, but will also understand peace and joy. 
Your commitment is not yet total. 
That is why you still have more to learn than to teach. 
When your equilibrium stabilises, you can teach <i>as much</i> as you learn. 
This will give you the proper sense of balance. 
Meanwhile, remember that <i>no effort is wasted</i>. 
Unless you remember this, you cannot avail yourself of <i>my</i> efforts, which are limitless. 
</p>

<p>
Have a good day. 
Since only eternity is real, why not use the illusion of time constructively? 
You might remember that “underneath are the Everlasting Arms”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-3" id="fn-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a> 
</p>

<p>“If you are ashamed of me before men, I will be ashamed of you before God”,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-4" id="fn-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> is interpreted as a threat <i>only</i> as long you remain in the first step.
</p>

<p>
What it <i>really</i> means is that if you are ashamed of me (or embarrassed by love), you will project and therefore make it impossible for me to reach you. 
Make every effort you can <i>not</i> to do this. 
I will help you as much as you will let me. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles make time and tide wait for all humans. 
They can heal the sick and raise the dead because humans themselves made both death and taxes, and can abolish both. 
Tax also means ‘strain’. 
One dictionary definition for miracles is: “That which, or one who, is of surpassing excellence or merit”.
</p>

<p><i>You</i> are a miracle. 
God creates only ‘that which, or one who, is of surpassing excellence or merit’. 
Humans are capable of this kind of creation, too, being in the image and likeness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-5" id="fn-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> of their own Creator. 
Anything else is only their own nightmare, and does not exist. 
Only the Creations of Light are real. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles  a part of an interlocking chain of forgiveness which, when completed, is the Atonement. 
This process works all the time and in all dimensions of time. 
You <i>are</i> your brother’s keeper; you can cancel out others’ sins’ (sin is lack of love) <i>effects</i>. 
Someday I want to tell everyone that not only are they forgiven but that the effects of all their sins are cancelled. 
This is what I have already told you. 
When I can tell them, they will be afraid for a long time, because they will remember many things, consciously or unconsciously, including  a lack of love which you cancelled out in advance by a miracle of devotion. 
</p>

<p>
I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to begin. 
My Atonement was for the cancelling out of all sins (that is, lack of love) which people could not otherwise correct. 
That is what the Biblical statement “underneath are the Everlasting Arms”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-6" id="fn-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> means. 
This means that He will backstop whenever human miracles will not suffice for atonement purposes. 
However, it is perfectly clear that when a person can atone by miracles, both giver and receiver are atoning. 
It is better to atone this way because of the mutual benefits involved.
</p>

<p>
“Inasmuch as you do it unto the least of these, my children” really ends with “you do it unto yourself and <i>me</i>”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-7" id="fn-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a> 
The reason why <i>you</i> come before me is because I do not need miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case <i>you</i> fail temporarily. 
</p>

<p>
Change the word ‘sin’ to ‘absence of love’. 
Sin is a humma-nmade word with threat connotations which they made up themselves. 
No <i>real</i> threat is involved anywhere. 
Just because ‘nature abhors a vacuum’, which is true enough, it does <i>not</i> follow that ‘a vacuum is filled with hellfire’. 
Nothing is gained by frightening yourself, and it is very destructive. 
Miracles need freedom from fear. 
Part of their Atonement value involves just that. 
Note that the word ‘atone’ really means ‘undo’. 
</p>

<p>The purpose of the Atonement is to restore everything <i>to</i> you. 
That is, to restore the awareness. 
You had everything when you were created, just as everyone did.
</p>

<p>
Having been restored to your original state, you naturally become part of the Atonement yourself. 
You now share <i>my</i> inability to tolerate the lack of love in yourself and in everyone else, and <i>must</i> 
join the <i>great crusade</i> to correct it. 
The slogan for this Crusade is, “Listen, Learn, and <i>do</i>”. 
</p>

<p>
This means Listen to My Voice, Learn to undo the error, and <i>do</i> something to correct it. 
</p>

<p>
The first two are not enough. 
The real members of <i>my</i> party are <i>active</i> workers.
</p>

<p>
The power to work Miracles <i>belongs</i> to you. 
I will create the right opportunities for you to do them. 
But you must be ready and willing to do them, since you are already able to. 
Doing them will bring conviction in the ability. 
I repeat that you will see Miracles through your hands through <i>mine</i>. 
Conviction really comes through accomplishment. 
Remember that ability is the potential. 
Achievement is its expression, and Atonement is the Purpose. 
</p>

<p>A miracle is a Universal Blessing from God through Me to all My Brothers. 
You once said that souls cannot rest until everyone has found salvation. 
This happens to be true. 
It is the privilege of the forgiven to forgive. 
The Disciples were officially and specifically told to heal others, as Physicians of the Lord. 
They were also told to heal themselves, and were promised that I would never leave them or forsake them. 
Atonement is the natural profession of the Children of God, because they have professed Me. 
</p>

<p>
That is what Professor really means. 
An associate must become associated with My strength. 
An assistant must assist both them and Me. 
The Children need both strength and help. 
You cannot help until you are strong. 
The Everlasting Arms are your strength, and the Wisdom of God is your help. 
</p>

<p>
“Heaven and Earth shall pass away”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-8" id="fn-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a> means that they will 
not always exist as separate states. 
My Word, which is the Resurrection and the Life,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-9" id="fn-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a> shall not pass away, because Life is Eternal. 
<i>You</i> are the work of God, and His Work is wholly loveable and wholly loving. 
This is how people <i>must</i> think of themselves in their heart, because this is what they <i>are</i>. 
</p>

<p>
“As a person thinks in their heart, so are they”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-10" id="fn-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a> 
</p>

<h3>The Relationship of Miracles and Revelation.</h3> 

<p>
Remember the point about Miracles as a means of organising different levels of consciousness. 
Miracles come from the below conscious (subconscious) level. 
Revelations come from the above conscious (superconscious) level. 
The conscious level is in between and reäcts to either subconscious or superconscious impulses in varying ratios. 
Freud was right about the classification, but not the names. 
He was also right that the content of consciousness is fleeting. 
Consciousness is the level which engages in the world, and is capable of responding to both external and internal impulses. 
Having no impulses from itself, and being primarily a mechanism for inducing response, it can be very 
wrong. 
</p>

<p>
For example, if the identification is with the body, consciousness may distort superconscious impulses by denying their 
Source, and seeking their impact in the orgasm. 
This is the result of the ‘mistaken identity’ confusion. 
</p>

<p>
If you will look back at the description of the <i>effects</i> of Revelation you will see that there <i>are</i> some similarities in the experiential results but hardly in the content.
</p>

<p>
Revelations induce complete but temporary suspension of doubt and fear. 
They represent the original form of communication between God and His Souls, before the intrusion of fire and ice 
made this impossible. 
It should be noted that they involve an extremely personal sense of closeness to Creation, which humans try to 
find in sexual relationships. 
This confusion is responsible for the depression and fear which are often associated with sex. 
</p>

<p>
Sex is often associated with lack of love, but Revelation is <i>purely</i> a love experience. 
Physical closeness <i>cannot</i> achieve this. 
As was said before, the subconscious impulses properly induce Miracles, which <i>are</i> interpersonal, and result in closeness to others. 
This can be misunderstood by a personally willful consciousness as an impulse toward sexual gratification. 
</p>

<p>
The Revelation unites Souls directly with God. 
</p>

<p>
The Miracle unites Souls directly with each other. 
Neither emanates from consciousness, but both are <i>experienced</i> there. 
This is essential, because consciousness is the state which <i>produces</i> action, though it <i>does not</i> Inspire it. 
</p>

<p>
Humans are free to believe what they choose. 
What they <i>do</i> attests to what they believe. 
</p>

<p>
The deeper levels of their subconscious always contain the impulse to Miracles, but they are free to fill its superficial levels, which are closer to consciousness, with the impulses of this world and to identify themselves with them. 
This results in denying themselves access to the miracle level underneath. 
In conscious actions, then, their interpersonal relationships also become superficial, and miracle-inspired relating becomes impossible. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles are a way of <i>earning</i> release from fear. 
</p>

<p>
Revelation induces a state in which fear has <i>already been</i> abolished. 
Miracles are thus a means, and Revelations are an end. 
In this sense, they work together. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles <i>do not</i> depend on Revelation. 
They <i>induce</i> it. 
You are quite capable of miracles already, but you are still too fearful for Revelations. 
</p>

<p>
Note that <i>your</i> Revelation occurred specifically after you had engaged at the visionary level in a process of <i>denying</i> fear. 
</p>

<p>
Revelation is intensely personal, and is actually not translatable into conscious content at all. 
That is why any attempt to describe it in words is usually incomprehensible, even to the writer himself at another time. 
This is why the Book of Revelations is essentially incomprehensible. 
Revelation induces <i>only</i> experience. 
Miracles, on the other hand, induce interpersonal <i>action</i>. 
In the end, these are more useful, because of their <i>impersonal</i> nature. 
</p>

<p>
In this phase of learning, working miracles is more valuable because freedom from fear cannot be thrust upon you. 
The experience cannot last. 
</p>

<p>
A propensity for Revelations, which in some people is very great, is the result of a high level of past communion. 
The propensity has a transitory nature from a descent into fear which has not yet been overcome. 
Your own ‘suspended’ state mitigates both extremes. 
This has been very apparent in the course of recent developmental patterns.
</p> 

<p>
Miracles are the essential course of <i>action</i> for all of you. 
They will strengthen you and stabilise you. 
</p>

<p>
The much more personal than usual notes you are taking today reflect the Revelatory experience. 
This does <i>not</i> produce the more generaliseable quality which this course is aimed at. 
They may, nevertheless, be of great help to you, since you asked for something that <i>would</i> help you personally. 
It depends on how you listen, and how well you understand the <i>coöperative</i> nature of your joint experience. 
You can help only by reading this note <i>first</i>. 
Ask later if this should be included in the written part of the course at all or whether you should keep these notes separately.
</p>

<p>
You should try to understand the <i>very</i> important difference between Christ-control and Christ-guidance. 
This is what made you fearful yesterday. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles praise God through humans. 
They praise God by honouring his Creations, affirming their perfection. 
They heal because they deny body-identification and affirm Soul-identification. 
By perceiving the Spirit, they adjust the levels and see them in proper alignment. 
This places the Spirit at the center, where Souls can communicate directly. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles should inspire gratitude, not awe. 
People should thank God for what they really are. 
The Children of God are very holy. 
The miracle honours their holiness. 
</p>

<p>
God’s Creations cannot lose their holiness, although it can be hidden. 
The miracle uncovers it, and brings it into the light where it belongs. 
</p>

<p>
Holiness can never be really hidden in darkness, but person can deceive themsevles on this point. 
This illusion makes them fearful, because in their heart they <i>know</i> it is an illusion. 
Like all illusions, they exert enormous efforts to establish their validity. 
The miracle sets validity where it belongs. 
Eternal validity belongs only to the Soul. 
The miracle acknowledges only the Truth. 
It thus dispels people’s illusions about themselves, and puts them into communion with themselves and with God.
</p>

<p>
Christ inspires all miracles, which are essentially intercessions. 
They intercede for people’s holiness, and make them holy. 
They place people beyond the physical laws, and raise them into the sphere of celestial order. 
In this order, people <i>are</i> perfect. 
</p>

<p>
The Soul never loses its communion with God. 
Only the mind and body need Atonement. 
The miracle joins in the Atonement of Christ by placing the mind in the service of the Spirit. 
This establishes the proper function of mind, and abolishes its errors. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles honour people, <i>because</i> they are loveable. 
They dispel illusions about themselves, and perceive the light in them. 
They thus atone for their errors by freeing them from their own nightmares. 
They release them from a prison in which they have imprisoned themselves. 
By freeing their mind from illusions, they restore their sanity, and place them at the feet of Jesus.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-11" id="fn-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a> 
</p>

<p>
Biblical quotation referring to healing of devil possessed man, in which the sufferer was subsequently found healed in his right mind, and sitting at feet of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
People’s minds can be possessed by illusions, but their Spirit is eternally free. 
If a mind creates without love, it can create an empty shell. 
This <i>can</i> be possessed by evil. 
But the Atonement restores the Soul to its proper place. 
Unless there is emptiness there is no danger, and emptiness is a false creation. 
The mind that serves the Spirit is invulnerable. 
</p>

<p>
The miracle restores the Soul to its fullness. 
By atoning for lack, it establishes perfect protection. 
The strength of the Soul leaves no room for intrusions. 
The forgiven are filled with the Soul, and their Soul forgives in return. 
It is the duty of the released to release their brothers. 
</p>

<p>
The forgiven <i>are</i> the means of Atonement. 
Those released by Christ must join in releasing their brothers, for this is the plan of Atonement. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles are the way in which minds that serve the spirit unite with Christ for the salvation (or release) of all God’s Creations.
</p> 

<p>
“God is not Mocked”,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-12" id="fn-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a> was intended as reässurance. 
You are afraid that what you wrote last night was contradictory, conflicting with some earlier points, especially because you were writing while you were all doped up. 
Remember, ‘God is not mocked’ under any circumstances. 
</p>

<p>
Contradictions in <i>my</i> word mean lack of understanding, or scribal failures, which I make every effort to correct. But they are still <i>not</i> crucial. 
The Bible has the same problem, I assure you, and it’s <i>still</i> being edited. 
Consider the power of <i>my word</i>, in that it has withstood all the attacks of error, and is the Source of Truth. 
</p>

<p>
There are certain advantages in being a Psychologist. 
A major one is the understanding of projection, and the extent of its results. 
Possession is very closely related to projection. 
‘Lucifer’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-13" id="fn-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a> could be literally translated ‘Light Bearer’. 
He literally <i>projected</i> himself from Heaven. 
Projection still has this ‘hurling’ connotation, because it involves hurling something you <i>do not</i> want, and regard as dangerous and frightening, to someone else. 
This is the opposite of the Golden Rule, and having placed this rule upside down, the reverse of miracles, or projection, follows automatically. 
</p>

<p>
The correction lies in accepting what is true in <i>yourself</i>, by bringing <i>all</i> that you are into light. 
Cayce was wrong about Possession, and he was also wrong about hurting himself. 
One of the major problems with miracle workers is that they are so sure that what they are doing is right, because they <i>know</i> it stems from love, that they do not pause to let <i>me</i> establish <i>my</i> limits. 
</p>

<p>
While what he (Cayce) did came from Me, he could <i>not</i> be induced to ask me each time whether I wanted him to perform this <i>particular</i> miracle. 
If he had, he would not have performed any miracles that could not get through constructively, and would thus have saved himself unnecessary strain. 
He burned himself out with indiscriminate miracles, and to this extent did not fulfill his own full purpose, and was also subject to the Scribal error I mentioned at the start. 
The Disciples were also prone to this. 
</p> 

<p>
The answer is <i>never</i> perform a miracle without asking me <i>if</i> you should. 
This spares you from exhaustion, and because you act under direct communication the trance becomes unnecessary. 
Because miracles are expressions of love, it does <i>not</i> follow that they will always be effective. 
I am the only one who can perform miracles indiscriminately, because I <i>am</i> the Atonement. 
You have a <i>role</i> in Atonement, which I will dictate <i>to</i> you. 
</p>

<p>
Remember, you already have a point about the involuntary nature of miracles. 
We also have established the fact that everything involuntary belongs under Christ-control, <i>not</i> under yours. 
Under Christ-control, Miracles <i>replenish</i> the doer as well as the receiver. 
</p>

<p>
Possession really means ‘Not under Christ-Control’, thus making the mind vulnerable to projection. 
The references to the earth-bound entering bodies really refer to the ‘taking over’ by their own earth-bound ‘thoughts’. This <i>is</i> Demon Possession. 
After all, Lucifer fell, but he was still an angel. 
He is thus the symbol for people. 
Atonement is the knowledge that the belief that angels can fall is false. 
It is true that mind can create projections as well as miracles, but it’s <i>not</i> true that projections are <i>real</i>. 
Any psychologist should understand this. 
This is what is meant by “The Truth shall set you free”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-14" id="fn-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a> 
</p>

<p>
Christ-controlled miracles are part of the Atonement, but Christ-guidance is personal, and leads to <i>personal</i> salvation. 
The impersonal nature of miracles is an essential ingredient, because this enables Me to control their distribution as I see fit. 
</p>

<p>
Christ-guidance, on the other hand, leads to the highly <i>personal</i> experience of Revelation. 
This is why it involves <i>personal</i> choice. 
A guide does <i>not</i> control, by definition, but he does <i>direct</i>, leaving the following up to you. 
“Lead us not into temptation”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-15" id="fn-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a> means ‘guide us out of our own errors’. 
Note that the word is ‘lead’, <i>not</i> order. 
</p>

<p>
“Take up your cross and follow me”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-16" id="fn-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a> should be interpreted to read ‘Recognise your errors and choose to abandon them by following My guidance‘. 
</p>

<p>
When you are afraid of Possession, you need only remember that error cannot really threaten Truth, which <i>always</i> 
can withstand its assaults. 
<i>Only</i> the error is really vulnerable. 
The “Princes of this World”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-17" id="fn-17" epub:type="noteref">17</a> are princes only because they are really angels. 
But they are free to establish their kingdom where they see fit. 
</p>

<p>
If you will remember that <i>all</i> princes <i>inherit</i> their power from the Father, the right choice becomes inevitable. 
<blockquote>
The soul is in a state of grace forever. <br />
People’s reality is <i>only</i> their soul. <br />
Therefore, people are in a state of Grace forever. 
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Atonement undoes all errors in this respect, and thus uproots the <i>real</i> source of fear. 
If you will check back at the reference to uprooting, you will understand it better in this context.
</p>

<p>
<i>Whenever</i> God’s reässurances are experienced as threat, it is <i>always</i> because people are defending their misplaced and misdirected love and loyalty. 
That is what projection always involves. 
</p>

<p>
‘Casting spells’ merely means ‘affirming error’, and error is lack of love. 
When man projects this onto others, he <i>does</i> imprison them, but only to the extent that he reïnforces errors they 
have already made. 
This distortion makes them vulnerable to the curse of others, since they have already cursed themselves. 
The miracle worker can only bless, and this undoes the curse and frees the soul from prison. 
</p>

<p>
Your slip should be noted. 
Some slips reach consciousness from the un-Christ-controlled subconscious, and betray a lack of love. 
</p>

<p>
But other slips come from the superconscious, which <i>is</i> in communion with God, and which can also break into consciousness. 
</p>

<p>
Your slip was an expression of a Soul gaining enough strength to request freedom from prison. 
It will ultimately <i>demand</i> it. 
</p>

<p>
You are wholly lovely. 
A perfect shaft of pure light. 
Before your loveliness the stars stand transfixed, and bow to the power of your will. 
</p>

<p>
What do children know of their creation, except what their Creator tells them? 
</p>

<p>
You were created <i>above</i> the angels because your role involves creation as well as protection. 
</p>

<p>
You who are in the image of the Father<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-18" id="fn-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a> need bow only to <i>Him</i>, before whom I kneel with you. 
</p>

<p>
This revelation was permitted because you did <i>not</i> project onto others the blame for your omission to <i>ask me</i> if you should transcribe the notes. 
The fact that others should have done so does not exempt you from your own omission. 
</p>

<p>
Thanks for blessing them with a miracle rather than cursing them with projection. 
</p>

<p>
They needn’t feel concerned about it either; so they forget. 
It happens all the time, until the habit of asking becomes involuntary. 
</p>

<p>Here is an example of how miracles should work. 
You did not jump into the question yourself, and even though you <i>did</i> rush out, you exerted no pressure on other’s reluctance. 
</p>

<p>
This gave <i>me</i> a chance to let you leave it to the real expert, whom I sent to answer the question. 
</p>

<p>
Miracles are examples of right thinking. 
Reality contact at all levels becomes strong and accurate, thus permitting correct delineation of intra- and inter-personal boundaries. 
As a result, the doer sees the truth as God created it. 
This is what is meant by the point on ‘perspective adjustment’. 
</p>


T 1 B 32. A miracle is a correction factor introduced into false thinking by <i>me</i>. 

TIB 32b. It acts as a catalyst, shaking up erroneous perception and 
snapping it into place. This correction factor places man under the 
Atonement principle, where his perception is healed. Until this has 
occurred, perception of the Divine Order is impossible. True depth 
perception becomes possible only at the highest order of perceptual 
integration. 

TIB 32c. The Spiritual eye is the mechanism of miracles, because 
what the Spiritual eye perceives <i>is</i> truth. The Spiritual eye perceives 
both the Creations of God <i>and</i> the creations of man. Among the 
creations of man, it can also separate the true from the false by its 
ability to perceive totally rather than selectively. It thus becomes the 
proper instrument for reality testing, which always involves the 
necessary distinction between the true and the false. 

TIB 33a. The miracle dissolves error because the Spiritual eye identifies error as false or unreal. This is the same as saying that by seeing 
light, darkness automatically disappears. T(23) -23 

54 See paragraph TIB 22h 


1-24

Chapter 1 - Introduction to Miracles 


TIB 33b. Darkness is lack of light. It does not have unique 
properties of its own. It is an example of the scarcity fallacy, from 
which only error can proceed. 

TIB 33c. (Truth is always abundant.Those who perceive and ac
knowledge that they have everything have no need for driven behavior of any kind. HS has other personal material related to this re 
pregnancy.) 

T 1 B 34. Miracles are a blessing from parents to children. This is just 
another way of phrasing the previous point about "from those who 
have more to those who have less." Children do <i>not</i> belong to parents, but they <i>do</i> need to share their greater abundance. If they are 
deprived, their perception becomes distorted. When this occurs, the 
whole family of God, or the Sonship, is impaired in its relationships. 

TIB 34b. Ultimately, every member of the family of God must return. The miracle calls to him to return, because it blesses and honours him even though he may be absent in spirit. 

TIB 35a. The miracle acknowledges all men as your brothers and 
Mine. It is a way of perceiving the Universal Mark of God in them. 
TIB 35b. (Tell B. that this is the true "strawberry mark" of Brotherhood. This is just a sign of special concern for him, because he keeps 
worrying about this.) 

TIB 35c. You might add that his false idea about his own exclusion 
from Universal Love is fallacious in your terms, and arrogant in his. 
HIS real specialness does <i>not</i> stem from exclusion, but from inclusion. <i>all</i> My Brothers are special. He should stop interpreting this 
as "all except B." This is ridiculous! T(24) -24 

TIB 35d. Tell him that the implied lack of love that his version contains is WAY off the Mark, and misses the level of right thinking entirely. He <i>must</i> heal his perception in this respect. He <i>must</i> work 
a miracle on behalf of himself here 55 (See the point about miracles as 

55 Urtext manuscript has a period here, apparently a typo.

a perception corrector) before he can effect miracles as creative energizers, which they are. 

TIB 35e. (Tell B. that 50,000,000 Frenchmen <i>can</i> be wrong, because 
the notion is too fragmented. What <i>can</i>'T be wrong is the Universal Sonship of which he is a part.) 

TIB 35f. God <i>would</i> be mocked if ANY of his creations lacked 
holiness. The Creation <i>is</i> whole. The mark of Wholeness is Holiness, 
not holes. THE SONSHIP <i>has</i> <i>no</i> HOLES ANYWHERE . 

TIB 36a. Wholeness is the perceptual content of the miracle. It thus 
corrects (or atones for) the faulty perception of lack. 

TIB 36b. We now turn to the fundamental distinction between miracles and projection. The stimulus <i>must</i> precede the response, and 
must also (determine) (influence) the kind of response that is 
evoked. The relationships of S and R are EXTREMELY intimate. 

(The behavioristic terminology is because this part deals with behavior.) 

TIB 36c. Behavior <i>is</i> response, so that the question "response to 
what?" becomes crucial. 

TIB 36d. Stimuli of all kinds are identified through 56 perception. 

You perceive the stimulus and behave accordingly. It follows, then, 
that: 

As ye perceive 

So will ye behave T(25) -25 

TIB 36e. (HS raises point that Biblical language is hardly behavioristic terminology. Answer: No, but they needn't be OUT of accord 
with each other, either.) 

TIB 36f. Consider the Golden Rule again. You are asked to behave 
toward others as you would have them behave toward you. 57 This 
means that the perception of both must be accurate, since the 

56 Urtext manuscript has it typed “thru” 

57 Matthew 7:12 “All things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do 
ye also unto them: for this is the law and the prophets.” 


1-26 


36 





Chapter 1 - Introduction to Miracles 


Golden Rule is the Order for appropriate behavior. You can’t behave 
appropriately unless you perceive accurately, because appropriate 
behavior DEPENDS on lack of level confusion. The presence of level 
confusion <i>always</i> results in variable reality testing, and hence 
variability in behavioral appropriateness. 

TIB 36g. All forms of self image debasement are FUNDAMENTAL 
perceptual distortions. They inevitably produce either self-contempt 
or projection, and usually both. 

TIB 36h. Since you and your neighbor are equal members of the 
same family, as you perceive both, so will you behave toward both. 
The way to perceive for Golden Rule behavior is to look out from 
the perception of your own holiness and perceive the holiness of 
others. T(26) -26 

TIB 36i. B. and you need considerable clarification of the channel role. 
Look carefully at Mrs. Albert. She is working miracles every day, 
because she knows who she is. I emphasize again that your 
tendency to forget names is not hostility, but a fear of involvement 
or RECOGNITION. You had misinterpreted human encounters as 
opportunities for magic rather than for miracles and so you tried to 
PROTECT THE NAME. This is a very ancient and primitive way of 
trying to protect a person. 

TIB 36j. NOTE The very old Jewish practice of changing the name 
of a person who is very ill, so that when the list is given to the Angel 
of Death, the person with that name will not be found. 

TIB 36k. This is a good example of the curiously literal regression 
which can occur in very bright people when they become afraid. 

You and B. both do it. Actually, it is a device closely related to the 
phobia, in the sense that they both narrow fear to a simple aspect of 
a much larger problem in order to enable them to avoid it. 

TIB 361. A similar mechanism works when you get furious about a 
comparatively minor expression by someone to whom you are ambivalent. A good example of this is your response to Jonathan, who 
<i>does</i> leave things around in very strange ways. Actually, he does 


37

this because he thinks that by minor areas of disorganization he can 
protect his stability. I remind you that you have done this yourself 
for years, and should understand it very well. This should be met 
with great charity, rather than with great fury. T(27) -27 

TIB 36m. The fury comes from your awareness that you do not love 
Jonathan as you should, and you narrow your lack of love by centering your hate on trivial behavior in an attempt to protect him from 
it. 58 You also call him Jonathan for the same reason (see previous 
reference). 

TIB 36n. Note that a name is a human symbol that "stands for" a 
person. Superstitions about names are very common for just that 
reason. That is also why people sometimes respond with anger 
when their names are spelled or pronounced incorrectly. 

TIB 36o. Actually, the Jewish superstition about changing the names 
was a distortion of a revelation about how to alter or avert death. 
What the revelation's proper content was that those "who change 
their mind" (not name) about destruction (or hate) do not need to 
die. Death is a human affirmation of a belief in hate. 59 That is why 
the Bible says "There is no death," 60 and that is why I demonstrated 
that death does not exist. Remember that I came to FULFILL the law 
by 61 RE-INTERPRETING 62 it. The law itself, if properly understood, 
offers only protection to man. Those who have not yet "changed 
their minds" have entered the "hellfire" concept into it. 

TIB 36p. Remember, I said before that because "nature abhors a 
vacuum", it does <i>not</i> follow that the vacuum is filled with hell fire. 
The emptiness engendered by fear should be replaced by love, be- 

58 Urtext manuscript omits “an”, handwritten mark-up fills it in. It is present in the Notes. 

59 Urtext manuscript has h and f overtyped, so it could be “hate” or “fate” but the “f ’ is the clearer. 

HLC has “fate.” The Notes however, clearly has “hate” so that is what we’re going with. 

60 Revelation 21:4 But has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has 
abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. 

2 Timothy 1:10 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor 
sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” 

61 Urtext manuscript omits “by”, handwritten mark-up fills it in. The Notes clearly includes the word 
“by.” 

62 Matthew 5:17 “Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to 
destroy but to fulfill.”

cause love and its absence are in the same dimension, and correction 
cannot be undertaken except WITHIN a dimension. Otherwise, 
there has been a confusion of levels. T(28) -28 

TIB 36q. Returning to Mrs. Albert (not Andrews), she corrected 
your error about her name without embarrassment and without 
hostility, because she has <i>not</i> made your own mistake about 
names. 

TIB 36r. She is not afraid, because 63 she knows she is protected. She 
made the correction <i>only</i> because you were inaccurate, and the 
whole question of embarrassment did not occur to her. 

TIB 36s. She was also quite unembarrassed when she told you that 
everything has to be done to preserve life, because you never can 
tell when God may come and say "Get up, Dave," and then he will. 

TIB 36t. She did not ask what <i>you</i> believed first, and afterwards 
merely added "and it’s true, too." The <i>right</i> answer to the SCT 
item is: WHEN THEY TOLD <i>me</i> WHAT <i>to</i> <i>do</i>. I "referred the 
question to the only <i>real</i> authority." 

TIB 36u. (HS note: If you ask somebody what he believes before you 
tell him what you believe, then you are implying that you will say 
what he approves. This is not "the real authority.") 

TIB 36v. You took a lot of notes on "Those who are ashamed of Me 
before men, them will I be ashamed of before God." 64 This was 
rather carefully clarified, even though the quotation is not quite 
right, but it doesn't matter. 

TIB 36w. The important thing is that elsewhere in the Bible it also 
says "Those who represent (or plead for) Me to men will be represented (or pleaded for) BY Me before God." 65 (Note: This quotation 
is also not the correct Biblical phrasing, but it <i>is</i> what it means.) 


63 Urtext manuscript has it typed “bee.” This is a common abbreviation used in Schucman’s shorthand 
for “because.” 

64 Matthew 10:33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father 
which is in heaven. Also Mark 8:38 and Luke 9:2. 

65 Matthew 10:32 Every one therefore who shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before 
my Father which is in heaven.

Note that one who represents also "witnesses for." The quotation 
thus means that you represent or "witness for" the authority in 
whom you believe. T(29) -29 

TIB 36x. Your witnessing DEMONSTRATES your belief, and thus 
strengthens it. 

TIB 36y. I assure you that I will "witness for" anyone who lets me, 
and to whatever extent he himself permits it. 

TIB 36z. Those who witness 66 for me are expressing, through their 
miracles, that they have abandoned deprivation in favor of the 
abundance they have learned <i>belongs</i> to them. 

TIB 37a. A MAJOR contribution of miracles is their strength in releasing man from his misplaced sense of isolation, deprivation, and 
lack. They are affirmations of Sonship, which is a state of completion 
and abundance . 67 

TIB 37b. B's very proper emphasis on "changing your mind" needs 
clarification. 

TIB 37c. Whatever is true and real is eternal, and <i>cannot</i> change or 
be changed. The Soul is therefore unalterable because it is ALREADY perfect, but the mind can elect the level it chooses to serve. 
The only limit which is put on its choice is that it <i>cannot</i> serve 
two masters . 68 


66 Isaiah 43:10 “You are My witnesses,” says the LORD, 

“And My servant whom I have chosen, 

That you may know and believe Me, 

And understand that I am He. 

Before Me there was no God formed, 

Nor shall there be after Me.” 

Isaiah 43:12 “I have declared and saved, 

I have proclaimed, 

And there was no foreign god among you; 

Therefore you are My witnesses,” 

Says the LORD, “that I am God. 

Acts 1:8 But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be 
witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. 

67 This is miracle principle 43 in the HLC. 

68 Luke 16:13 “No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or 
else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.”

TIB 37d. While the ballot itself is a secret one, and the right to vote 
is fully protected, voting <i>always</i> entails both election <i>and</i> rejection. If two candidates are voted for, for the same position, the machine cancels the ballot automatically. 

TIB 37e. This is necessary, because a split vote does not represent 
ANY <i>real</i> allegiance. T(30) -30 

TIB 37f. Free will is the attribute of the mind, <i>not</i> the Soul. The 
Soul always remains changeless, because it never leaves the sight of 
God. 

TIB 37g. The Creation of the Soul is already fully accomplished. The 
mind, if it votes to do so, becomes a medium by which the Soul can 
create along the line of its own creation. If it does not freely elect to 
do so, it retains this creative ability, but places itself under tyrannous rather than authoritative control. As a result, what it creates is 
imprisonment, because such are the dictates of tyrants. 

TIB 37h. To "change your mind" means to place it at the disposal of 
True authority. The miracle is thus a sign that the mind has elected 
to be guided by Christ in HIS service. The abundance of Christ 69 is 
the natural result of choosing to follow him. 

TIB 37i. P.S . The reason you have been late recently (for work) because you were taking dictation is merely because you didn't remember to ask me when to stop. This is an example of the "indiscriminate or uncontrolled" miracle-working we already spoke of. It 
is well-meant but ill-advised. 

TIB 37j. I prompted that call from Jack (taxi man - couldn’t pick HS 
up, etc.) to show you that this is not necessary. Also, the other man 
needed the money more today. 

TIB 37k. NOTE that you managed to fill your scribal role with no 
interruptions, and were also on time. 

TIB 371. NOTE also that you closed the book and put it aside WITHOUT consulting me. ASK "Is that all?" ANSWER : No: add the fol-

lowing: These notes are serving, among other things, to replace the 
"handwriting on the wall" which you once saw next to your own 
altar, which read "You have been 70 weighed in the balance and 
found wanting."T(31) -31 

TIB 37m. Scribes <i>must</i> learn Christ-control, to replace their former 
habits, which DID produce scarcity rather than abundance. From 
errors of this kind, the sense of deprivation <i>is</i> inevitable, but very 
easily corrected. 

TIB 37n. The following is in relation to question about sex. Tell B. 
"the one more river" is related to sex. You might even explain it to 
him as a "tidal wave", a term which he will understand. <i>you</i> <i>won’t</i>. 
TIB 37o. Both of you are involved with unconscious distortions 
(above the miracle level), which are producing a dense cover over 
miracle-impulses which makes it hard for them to reach consciousness. Sex and miracles are both WAYS OF RELATING. The nature of 
any interpersonal relationship is limited or defined by what you 
want it to <i>do</i> which is WFFY you want it in the first place. Relating 
is a way of achieving an outcome. 

TIB 37p. Indiscriminate sexual impulses resemble indiscriminate 
miracle impulses in that both result in body image misperceptions. 
The first is an expression of an indiscriminate attempt to reach 
communion through the body. This involves not only the improper 
self identification, but also disrespect for the individuality of others. 
Self-control is <i>not</i> the whole answer to this problem, though I am 
by no means discouraging its use. It must be understood, however, 
that the underlying mechanism must be uprooted (a word you both 
should understand well enough by now not to regard it as frightening). T(32) -32 

TIB 37q. <i>all</i> shallow roots 71 have to be uprooted, because they are 
not deep enough to sustain you. The illusion that shallow roots can 


70 Urtext manuscript omits “been”, which is handwritten in. The Notes clearly has the word present.

these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.”

be deepened and thus made to hold is one of the corollaries on 
which the reversal of the Golden Rule / 2 referred to twice before, is 
balanced. As these false underpinnings are uprooted (or given up), 
equilibrium is experienced as unstable. But the fact is that NOTHING is less stable than an orientation which is upside down. Anything that holds it this way is hardly conducive to greater stability. 
TIB 37r. The whole danger of defenses lies in their propensity to 
hold misperceptions rigidly in place. This is why rigidity is regarded AS stability by those who are off the mark. 

TIB 37s. NOTE The only final solution - (no, Helen, this has nothing 
to do with the Nazi use of the term.) You just got frightened again. 
One of the more horrible examples of inverted or upside down 
thinking (and history is full of horrible examples of this) is the fact 
that the Nazis spelled their appalling error with capital letters. I 
shed many tears over this, but it is by no means the only time I said 
"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do." 

TIB 37t. All actions which stem from reverse thinking are literally 
the behavioral expressions of those who know not what they do . 73 
Actually, Jean Dixon was right in her emphasis on "Feet on the 
ground and fingertips in the Heaven," though she was a bit too literal 
for your kind of understanding. Many people knew exactly what 
she meant, so her statement was the right miracle for them. T(33) -33 
TIB 37u. For you and Bill, it would be better to consider the concept 
in terms of reliability and validity. A rigid orientation can be extremely reliable, even if it <i>is</i> upside down. In fact, the more consistently upside down it is, the more reliable it is, because consistency 
always held up better mathematically than test-re-test comparisons, 
which were <i>always</i> on shaky ground. You can check this against 
Jack's notes if you wish, but I assure you its true. Split-half reliability is statistically a MUCH stronger approach. The reason for this is 


72 Matthew 7:12 “Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law 
and the Prophets.” 

73 Luke 23:34 Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.” And they 
divided His garments and cast lots. 


43

Volume I Text 


that correlation which is the technique applied to test-re-test comparisons, measures only the EXTENT OF association, and does not 
consider the Direction at all. 

TIB 37v. But two halves of the same thing <i>must</i> go in the same direction, if there is to be accuracy of measurement. This simple statement is really the principle on which split half reliability, a means of 
estimating INTERNAL consistency, rests. 

TIB 37w. Note, however, that both approaches leave out a very important dimension. Internal consistency criteria disregard time, because the focus is on one-time measurements. Test-retest comparisons are BASED on time intervals, but they disregard direction. 

TIB 37x. It is possible, of course, to use both, by establishing internal 
consistency <i>and</i> stability over time. You will remember that Jack 
once told his class that the more sophisticated statisticians are concentrating more and more on reliability, rather than validity. The 
rationale for this, as he said, was that a reliable instrument <i>does</i> 
measure something. He also said, however, that validity is still the 
ultimate goal, which reliability can only serve. T(34) -34 

TIB 37y. I submit (I'm using Jack's language in this section, because 
it always had a special meaning for you. So did Jack.) Your confusion of sex and statistics is an interesting example of this whole issue. Note that night you spent in the scent of roses doing a complex 
factorial analysis of covariance. It's a funny story to others, because 
they see a different kind of level confusion than the one you yourself 
were making. You might recall that <i>you</i> wanted that design, and 
Jack opposed it. One of the real reasons why that evening was so 
exhilarating was because it represented a "battle of intellects", (both 
good ones, by the way), each communicating exceptionally clearly 
but on opposite sides. The sexual aspects were naturally touched off 
in both of you, because of the sex and aggression confusion.

TIB 37z. (It is especially interesting that after the battle ended on a 
note of compromise 74 with your agreeing with Jack, he wrote in the 
margin of your notes "virtue is triumphant." (HS note re submission-dominance, feminine-masculine roles, entered into this.) While 
this (remark) was funny to both of you at the time, you might consider its truer side. The virtue lay in the complete respect each of 
you offered to the other's intellect. Your mutual sexual attraction 
was also shared. The error lay in the word "triumphant." This had 
the "battle" connotation, because neither of you was respecting <i>all</i> 
of the other. There is a great deal more to a person than intellect and 
genitals. The omission was the Soul.)T(35) -35 

TIB 37aa. I submit (after a long interruption) that if a mind (Soul) is 
in valid relationship with God, it <i>can</i>'T be upside down. Jack and the 
other very eminent methodologists have abandoned validity in favor of reliability because they have lost sight of the end and are concentrating on the means. 

TIB 37ab. Remember the story about the artist who kept devoting 
himself to inventing better and better ways of sharpening pencils. He 
never created anything, but he had the sharpest pencil in town. (The 
language here is intentional. Sex is often utilized on behalf of very 
similar errors. Hostility, triumph, vengeance, self-debasement, and 
all sort of expressions of the lack of love are often <i>very</i> clearly seen 
in the accompanying fantasies. But it is a PROFOUND error to 
imagine that, because these fantasies are so frequent (or occur so reliably), that this implies validity. Remember that while validity implies reliability the relationship is <i>not</i> reversible. You can be 
wholly reliable, and ENTIRELY wrong. 

TIB 37ac. While a reliable test <i>does</i> measure something, what USE 
is the test unless you discover what the "something" is? And if validity is more important than reliability, and is also necessarily im- 


74 The words “on a note of compromise” are crossed out. In the Notes they are present and even 
underlined for emphasis.

plied BY it, why not concentrate on VALIDITY and let reliability fall 
naturally into place. 

TIB 37ad. Intellect may be a "displacement upward", but sex can be 
a "displacement outward." How can man "come close" to others 
through the parts of him which are really invisible? The word "invisible" means "cannot be seen or perceived." T(36) -36 What cannot 
be perceived is hardly the right means for improving perception. 

TIB 37ae. The confusion of miracle impulse with sexual impulse is a 
major source of perceptual distortion, because it INDUCES rather 
than straightening out the basic level-confusion which underlies all 
those who seek happiness with the instruments of the world. A desert is a desert is a desert. You can do anything you want in it, but 
you <i>cannot</i> change it from what it <i>is</i>. It still lacks water, which is 
why it <i>is</i> a desert (Bring up that dream about the Bluebird. While 
HS was looking for this dream, she came across another. The message was to bring both, as an excellent example of how extremely 
good HS had become over the intervening 25 years at sharpening 
pencils. Note that the essential content hasn't changed; it’s just better written.) The thing to do with a desert is to LEAVE. 

T l B 38. Miracles arise from a miraculous state of mind. By being 
One, this state of mind goes out to ANYONE, even without the 
awareness of the miracle worker himself. The impersonal nature of 
miracles is because Atonement itself is one, uniting all creations 
with their Creator. 

TIB 39a. The miracle is an expression of an inner awareness of 
Christ and acceptance of his Atonement. The mind is then in a state of 
Grace, and naturally becomes gracious, both to the Host within and 
the stranger without. By bringing in the stranger, he becomes your 
brother. 75 T(37)-37 

TIB 39b. The miracles you are told <i>not</i> to perform have not lost 
their value. They are still expressions of your own state of Grace, but 

73 Matthew 25:35 For I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was 
a stranger and you took Me in; 


1-36

Chapter 1 - Introduction to Miracles 


the <i>action</i> aspect of the miracle should be Christ-controlled, because of His complete Awareness of the Whole Plan. The impersonal nature of miracle-mindedness ensures <i>your</i> own Grace, but 
only Christ is in a position to know where Grace can be BESTOWED. 

TIB 40a. A miracle is never lost. It touches many people you may 
not even know, and sometimes produces undreamed of changes in 
forces of which you are not even aware. This is not your concern. It 
will also always bless <i>you</i>. This is not your concern, either. But it <i>is</i> 
the concern of the Record. The Record is completely unconcerned 
with reliability, being perfectly valid because of the way it was set 
up. It <i>always</i> measures what it was supposed to measure. 

TIB 40b. I want to finish the instructions about sex, because this is 
an area the miracle worker <i>must</i> understand. 

TIB 40c. Inappropriate sex drives (or misdirected miracle-impulses) 
result in guilt if expressed, and depression if denied. We said before 
that <i>all</i> real pleasure comes from doing God’s will . 76 Whenever it 
is <i>not</i> done an experience of lack results. This is because <i>not</i> doing the will of God <i>is</i> a lack of self. 

TIB 40d. Sex was intended as an instrument for physical creation to 
enable Souls to embark on new chapters in their experience, and 
thus improve their record. The pencil was <i>not</i> an end in itself. (See 
earlier section.) It was an aid to the artist in his own creative 
endeavors. T(38) -38 As he made new homes for Souls and guided 
them through the period of their own developmental readiness, he 
learned the role of the father himself. The whole process was set up 
as a learning experience in gaining Grace. 

TIB 40e. The pleasure which is derived from sex AS SUCH is reliable only because it stems from an error which men shared. 
AWARENESS of the error produces the guilt. DENIAL of the error 
results in projection. CORRECTION of the error brings release. 


76 Ephesians 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the 
gift of God.

TIB 40f. The only VALID use of sex is procreation. It is <i>not</i> truly 
pleasurable in itself. "Lead us not into Temptation" means "Do not 
let us deceive ourselves into believing that we can relate in peace to 
God or our brothers with ANYTHING external."T(39) -39 

TIB 40g. The "sin of onan " 77 was called a "sin" because it involved a 
related type of self-delusion; namely, that pleasure WITHOUT relating can exist. 

TIB 40h. To repeat an earlier instruction, the concept of either the 
self or another as a "sex-OBJECT" epitomizes this strange reversal. 
As B. put it, and very correctly, too, it <i>is</i> objectionable, but only because it is invalid. Upside down logic produces this kind of thinking. 

TIB 40i. Child of God, you were created to create the good, the 
beautiful, and the holy. Do not lose sight of this. You were right in 
telling B. to invite Me to enter anywhere temptation arises. I will 
change the situation from one of inappropriate sexual attraction to 
one of impersonal miracle-working. The concept of changing the 
channel for libidinal expression is Freud's greatest contribution, except that he did not understand what "channel" really means. 

TIB 40j. The love of God, for a little while, must still be expressed 
through one body to another. That is because the real vision is still 
so dim. Everyone can use his body best by enlarging man's 
perception, so he can see the real VISION. THIS VISION is invisible 
to the physical eye. The ultimate purpose of the body is to render 
itself unnecessary. Learning to do this is the only real reason for its 
creation. 

TIB 40k. NOTE Scribes have a particular role in the Plan of Atonement, because they have the ability to EXPERIENCE revelations 


77 Genesis 38:8-11 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a 
husband’s brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother. And Onan knew that the seed would not 
be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest 
he should give seed to his brother. And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and he 
slew him also. Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father’s house, 
till Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his brethren. And Tamar went and 
dwelt in her father’s house.

themselves, and also to put into words enough of the experience to 
serve as a basis for miracles. T(40) -40 

TIB 401. (This refers to experiences at the visionary level, after which 
HS wrote "If you will tell me what to do, I will to do it." She had not 
known that the word "to" was inserted, and had merely intended to 
write "I will do it." This recognition had a terrific impact on HS.) 

TIB 40m. This is why you EXPERIENCED that revelation about "I 
will to do" <i>very</i> personally, but also WROTE IT: What you wrote 
<i>can</i> be useful to miracle workers other than yourself. We said before that prayer is the medium of miracles. The miracle prayer <i>is</i> 
what you wrote, that is "If you will tell me what to do, I will to do it." * 
TIB 40n. This prayer is the door that leads out of the desert forever. 

TIB 40o. ^(Correction next day. This is not a complete statement, 
because it does not exclude the negative. We have already told you 
to add "and <i>not</i> to do what you would not have me do." in connection with miracles. The distinction has also been made here between "miracle-mindedness" as a STATE, and "miracle-doing" as its 
expression. 

TIB 40p. The former needs <i>your</i> careful protection, because it is a 
state of miracle-READINESS. This is what the Bible means in the 
many references to "Hold yourself ready" and other similar injunctions. 

TIB 40q. Readiness here means keep your perception right side up, 
(or valid), so you will <i>always</i> be ready, willing, and able. These 
are the essentials for "listen, learn, and do." You must be 
READY to listen 
WILLING to learn 
and ABLE to do 

TIB 40 r. Only the last is involuntary, because it is the APPLICATION of miracles which must be Christ-controlled. But the other 
two, which are the voluntary aspects of miracle-mindedness, <i>are</i> 
up to you. T(41) -41 


49

Volume I Text 


TIB 40s. To channelize <i>does</i> have a "narrowing down" connotation, though <i>not</i> in the sense of lack. The underlying state of mind, 
or Grace is a total commitment. Only the DOING aspect involves 
the channel at all. This is because doing is always specific. 

TIB 40t. As Jack said, "A reliable instrument must measure something," but a channel is also valid. It must learn to do <i>only</i> what it 
is supposed to do. Change the prayer to read: 

If you will tell me what to do, 

<i>only</i> THAT I will to do. 

TIB 40u. NOTE HS objects to doggerel sound of this, and regards it 
as very inferior poetry. ANSWER : It's hard to forget, though. 

TIB 40v. The Revelation is literally unspeakable, because it is an experience of unspeakable love. The word "Awe" should be reserved 
only for revelations, to which it is perfectly and correctly applicable. 
It is <i>not</i> appropriately applied to miracles, because a state of true 
awe is worshipful. It implies that one of a lesser order stands before 
the Greater One. This is the case only when a Soul stands before his 
Creator. Souls are perfect creations, and should be struck with awe 
in the presence of the Creator of Perfection. 

TIB 40w. The miracle, on the other hand, is a sign of love among 
equals. Equals cannot be in awe of each other, because awe <i>always</i> implies inequality. Awe is not properly experienced even to 
me. That is why in that short introductory vision, I knelt beside you, 
FACING the light. 

TIB 40x. An Elder Brother is entitled to respect for his greater experience, and a reasonable amount of obedience for his greater wisdom. He is also entitled to love, because he is a brother, and also to 
devotion, if he is devoted. It is only my own devotion that entitles 
me to yours. But you will notice that I have knelt at your altar as 
readily as I would ever have you kneel at mine. T(42) -42

Chapter 1 - Introduction to Miracles 


TIB 40y. There is nothing about me that you cannot attain . 78 1 have 
nothing that does not come from God. The main difference between 
us as yet is that I have NOTHING ELSE. This leaves me in a state of 
true holiness, which is only a POTENTIAL in you. 

TIB 40z. "No man cometh to the Father but by me " 79 is among the 
most misunderstood statements in the Bible. It <i>does</i> <i>not</i> mean 
that I am in any way separate (or different) from you, EXCEPT IN 
TIME. Now, we know that time does not exist. Actually, the statement is much more meaningful if it is considered on a vertical rather 
than a horizontal axis. Regarded along the vertical, man stands below me, and I stand below God. In the process of "rising up", I <i>am</i> 
higher. This is because without me the distance between God and 
man is too great for man to encompass. I bridge the distance as an 
Elder Brother 80 to man, on the one hand, and a Son of God on the 
other. My devotion to my brothers has placed me in charge of the 
Sonship, which I can render complete only to the extent I can 
SHARE it. 

TIB 40aa. This appears to contradict another statement: "I and my 
Father are one ." 81 It doesn't. There are still separate parts in the 
statement, in recognition of the fact that the Father is GREATER. 
Actually, the original statement was "are of one KIND." 

TIB 40ab. The Holy Spirit is the Bringer of Revelations, not miracles. 
Revelations are INDIRECTLY inspired by me, because I am close to 
the Holy Spirit, and alert to revelation-readiness in my brothers. 

T(43) -431 can thus BRING DOWN to them more than they can 
DRAW down to themselves. Jean Dixon's description is perhaps a 
better statement of my position. Because my feet are on the ground 


78 John 14:12 “Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do 
also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto the Father.” 

79 John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the 
Father, but by me.” 

80 Romans 8:29 For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, 
that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. 

81 John 10:30 “I and the Father are one.”

and my hands are in heaven, I can bring down the glories of Heaven 
to my brothers on earth. 

TIB 40ac. The Holy Spirit is the Highest Communication Medium. 
Miracles do not involve this type of communication, because they 
are TEMPORARY communicative devices. When man can return to 
his original form of communication with God by direct REVELATION, the need for miracles is over. The Holy Spirit mediates higher 
to lower order communication, keeping the direct channel from God 
to man open for revelation. Revelation is <i>not</i> reciprocal. It is always FROM God <i>to</i> man. This is because God and man are <i>not</i> 
equal. The miracle is reciprocal because it <i>always</i> involves equality. 

TIB 40ad. In the longitudinal (or horizontal) plane, the true equality 
of all men in the Sonship appears to involve almost endless time. 

But we know that time is only an artifact introduced as a learning 
aid. 

TIB 4la. The miracle is a learning device which lessens the need for 
time. The sudden shift 82 from horizontal to vertical perception 
which the miracle entails introduces an interval from which the doer 
and the receiver both emerge much farther along in time than they 
would otherwise have been. 

TIB 41b. A miracle has thus the unique property of abolishing time 
by rendering the space of time it occupies unnecessary. There is <i>no</i> 
relation between the time a miracle TAKES and the time it COVERS. 
It substitutes FOR learning that might have taken thousands of 
years. It does this by the underlying recognition of perfect equality 
and holiness between doer and receiver on which the miracle rests. 
T(44) -44 It is unstable, but perfectly consistent, that is, it does not occur 
predictably across time, and it rarely occurs in comparable forms. 
But within ITSELF it is perfectly consistent. Since it contains NOTH- 

82 The manuscript has the plural “shifts” whereas the Notes has the singular “shift.” The verb in the 
sentence, “introduces” is singular in both so we conclude the pluralization was a typing mistake. It 
must be either “shifts introduce” or “shift introduces.”

Chapter 1 - Introduction to Miracles 


ING BUT an acknowledgment of equality and worth, all parts <i>are</i> 
equal. This establishes the prerequisite for validity. 

TIB 4lc. We said before that the miracle abolishes time. It does this 
by a process of COLLAPSING it. It thus abolishes certain INTERVALS within it. It does this, however, WITHIN the larger temporal 
sequence. 

TIB 4ld. The validity of the miracle, then, is PREDICTIVE, not logical, within the temporal schema. It establishes an out-of-pattern time 
interval, which is <i>not</i> under the usual laws of time. Only in this 
sense is it timeless. By collapsing time, it literally saves time, much 
the way "daylight saving time" does. It reärranges the distribution 
of light. 

TIB 41e. The miracle is the only device which man has at his immediate disposal for controlling time. Only the Revelation TRANSCENDS it, having nothing to do with time at all. The miracle is 
much like the body, in that both are learning aids which aim at facilitating a state in which they are unnecessary. When the Soul is 
finally in the original state of direct communication, neither the 
body nor the miracle serves any purpose. 

TIB 4lf. While he is IN the body, however, man can choose between 
loveless and miraculous channels of creativity. He can create an 
empty shell (see previous reference), but he <i>does</i> <i>not</i> create nothing at all. He can wait, delay, paralyze himself, reduce his creativity 
almost to nothing, and even introduce a real developmental arrest 
or regression. But he <i>cannot</i> abolish his creativity. He <i>can</i> destroy his medium of communication, but <i>not</i> his potential. T(45) -45 
TIB 4lg. He was <i>not</i> created by his own free will. Only what HE 
creates is his to decide. The basic decision of the miracle-minded is 
<i>not</i> to wait on time any longer than is necessary. Time can waste, 
as well as be wasted. The miracle-worker, therefore, accepts the 
time-control factor of the miracle gladly, because he knows that 
every collapse of time brings all men closer to the ultimate RELEASE from time, in which the Son and the Father <i>are</i> one. 


53

TIB 41h. The real meaning of "are of one kind" is "of one mind or 
will." When the will of the Sonship and the Father are one, their perfect accord <i>is</i> Heaven. T(46) -46 

TIB 41i. ASIDE Tell B. he is right in providing you with the consistent strength you need to get, and he needs to offer. Your instability 
and his weakness have resulted from bad karmic choices, and your 
relationship NOW is crucial for the future. You must both exert 
every effort to restore it to what it once was. Both of you are correcting where you have failed before. This has already enabled you to 
fulfill a very unexpected role in your own joint salvation, and the 
salvation of many other children I will entrust increasingly to you. 
These are by no means chosen at random. B. should know that his 
preparation is not only in terms of sharing in the results of your better application of some rather unusual talents. His own role, which 
he will understand after his preparation is complete, will be equally 
surprising. He will need your help then, as you need his strength 
now. 

TIB 4lj. Note that you <i>do not</i> need his help as a scribe, because 
you developed this ability by your own efforts, and finally placed 
them at <i>my</i> disposal. By lending you his strength, he strengthens 
himself. When he gains this through his own efforts, he will need 
your help in a very unexpected way. But this is just another example 
of the reciprocal nature of miracles. 

TIB 4lk. Equality does not imply homogeneity NOW. When EVERYONE has EVERYTHING, individual contributions to the Sonship 
will no longer be necessary. When the Atonement has been completed, <i>all</i> talents will be shared by <i>all</i> of the Sons of God. God is 
<i>not</i> partial. All of His children have His total love, and all of his 
gifts are given freely to everyone alike. 

TIB 4ll. "Except you become as little children " 83 means unless you 
fully recognise your complete dependence on God, you cannot 

83 Matthew 18:3 And said, “Assuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little 
children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.”

know the real power of the Son in his true relationship with the Father. T(47) -47 

TIB 4lm. You and B. <i>do</i> have special talents which are needed for 
the Celestial speedup at this time. But note that the term speed-up is 
not one which relates to the TRANSCENDING of time. 

TIB 4ln. When time is abolished, and all of the Sons of God have 
come home, no special agents will be necessary. But do not underestimate the power of special agents now, or the great need there is for 
them. I do not claim to be more than that myself. No one in his Right 
Mind, (a term which should be specially noted) ever wants either 
more or less than that. Those who are called on to witness for me 
NOW are witnessing for all men, as I am. 

TIB 4lo. The role of the Priestess was once to experience 
Revelations and to work miracles. The purpose was to bring those 
not yet available for direct Revelations into proper focus for them. 
Heightened perception was always the essential Priestess attribute. 
TIB 41p. (This is the first time that HS ever said that she would be 
honoured if there were any notes.) 

TIB 4lq. (Neither B. nor I is really clear about how sexual-impulses 
can be directly translated into miracle-impulses.) The fantasies that I 
mentioned yesterday (refers to discussion HS and B. had) provide an 
excellent example of how you switch. (Now switch the pronoun references, or it will be too confusing.) 

TIB 4lr. Fantasies are distorted forms of thinking, because they always involve twisting perception into unreality. Fantasy is a debased form of vision. Visions and Revelations are closely related. 
Fantasies and projection are more closely associated, because both attempt to control external reality according to false internal needs. 
"Live and let live" happens to be a very meaningful injunction. 

Twist reality in any way, and you are perceiving destructively. Reality was lost through usurpation, which in turn produced tyranny. I 
told you you were now restored to your former role in the Plan of 
Atonement. But you must still choose freely to devote your heritage 


55

Volume I Text 


to the greater Restoration. As long as a single slave remains to walk 
the earth, your release is not complete. Complete restoration of the 
Sonship is the only true goal of the miracle-minded. T(48) -48 

TIB 41s. Sexual fantasies are distortions of perception by definition. 
They are a means of making false associations, and obtaining pleasure from them. Man can do this only because he <i>is</i> creative. But although he can perceive false associations, he can never make them 
real except to himself. As was said before, man believes in what he 
creates. If he creates a miracle, he will be equally strong in his belief 
in that. The strength of his conviction will then sustain the belief of 
the miracle receiver. 

TIB 4lt. <i>no</i> fantasies, sexual or otherwise, are true. Fantasies become totally unnecessary as the Wholly satisfying nature of reality 
becomes apparent. The sex impulse <i>is</i> a miracle impulse when it is 
in proper focus. One individual sees in another the right partner for 
"procreating the stock" (Wolff was not too far off here), and also for 
their joint establishment of a creative home. This does not involve 
fantasy at all. If I am asked to participate in the decision, the decision will be a Right one, too. 

TIB 41u. In a situation where you or another person, or both, experience inappropriate sex impulses, <i>know</i> <i>first</i> that this is an 
expression of fear. Your love toward each other is <i>not</i> perfect, and 
this is why the fear arose. Turn immediately to me by denying the 
power of the fear, and ask me to help you to replace it with love . 84 
This shifts the sexual impulse immediately to the miracle-impulse, 
and places it at <i>my</i> disposal. 

TIB 4lv. Then acknowledge the true creative worth of both yourself 
<i>and</i> the other one. This places strength where it belongs. Note that 
sexual fantasies are <i>always</i> destructive (or depleting), in that they 
perceive another in an inappropriate creative role. Both people are 
perceived essentially as "objects" fulfilling TFiEIR OWN pleasure 


84 In the Notes this appears to be “will love” rather than “with love.” In the Urtext manuscript it appears 
as “will (with) love.” It seems fairly clear that the Notes represents a scribal error and the correct word 
is “with.”

drives. This dehumanized view is the source of the DEPLETING use 
of sex. Freud's description is purely NEGATIVE, that is, as a release 
from the UNPLEASANT. He also observed that the tension from id 
impulses never completely abates. T(49) -49 

TIB 41w. What he should have said is that the shift from miracle- 
impulses to sexual impulses was debilitating in the first place, because of the level-confusion involved. This set up a state in which 
real release was impossible. Note also that Freud's notion of sex was 
as a device for inducing RELAXATION, which he confused with 
PEACE. 

TIB 41x. Inappropriate sex relaxes only in the sense that it may induce physical sleep. The miracle, on the other hand, is an ENERGIZER. It always strengthens, and never depletes. It <i>does</i> induce 
peace, and by establishing tranquility (not relaxation) it enables both 
giver and receiver to enter into a state of Grace. Here his miracle- 
mindedness, (not release from tension) is restored. 

TIB 4ly. Tension is the result of a building-up of unexpressed miracle-impulses. This can be truly abated only by releasing the miracle- 
drive, which has been blocked. Converting it to sexual libido merely 
produces further blocking. Never foster this illusion in yourself, or 
encourage it in others. An "object" is incapable of release, because it 
is a concept which is deprived of creative power. The recognition of 
the real creative power in yourself <i>and</i> others brings release because it brings peace. 

TIB 4lz. The peace of God which passeth understanding <i>can</i> keep 
your hearts now and forever. 85 

TIB 4laa. There are only two short additions needed here: 

1. Your earlier acute problem in writing things down came from a 
MUCH earlier misuse of very great scribal abilities. These were 
turned to secret rather than shared advantage, depriving it (?) of its 
miraculous potential, and diverting it into possession. This is much

your thoughts in Christ Jesus.

like the confusion of sex impulses with possession-impulses. Some 
of the original material is still in the Temple. This is why you became so afraid about Atlantis. B. has his own reasons. T(50) -50 

TIB 41ab.2. Retain your miracle-minded attitude toward Rosie <i>very</i> 
carefully. She once hurt both of you, which is why she is now your 
servant. But she is blessed in that she sees service as a source of joy. 
Help her straighten out her past errors by contributing to your welfare now. 

TIB 4lac. (special Revelation re HS - OMISSION 1 , 86 ) 

TIB 4lad. HS question re: past memories. ANSWER : As long as you 
remember <i>always</i> that you never suffered anything because of 
anything that anyone ELSE did, this is not dangerous. 

TIB 41ae. Remember that you who want peace can find it only by 
complete forgiveness. You never really WANTED peace before, so 
there was no point in knowing how to get it. This is an example of 
the "need to know" principle, which was established by the Plan of 
Atonement long before CIA. 

TIB 41af. No kind of knowledge is acquired by anyone unless he 
wants it, or believes in some way he NEEDS it. A psychologist does 
<i>not</i> need a lesson on the hierarchy of needs as such, but like everyone else, he <i>does</i> need to understand his own. 

TIB 41ag. This particular set of notes will be the only one which 
deals with the concept of "lack", because while the concept does not 
exist in the Creation of God, it is <i>very</i> apparent in the creations of 
man. It is, in fact, the essential difference. 


86 From the Notes 5:46-47 the following was omitted: 

“Priestess, a brother has knelt at your shrine. Heal Him through Me.” 

I have an idea that the shrine merely represented the “altar within,” which the Priestess served. I 
imagine that the communication form was direct, and the “brother” always nameless. I - the Priestess 
responded automatically by praying directly to God, standing with upraised arms to draw down a 
blessing on her brother, who knelt outside. Her response was completely automatic and impersonal. 
She never even thought of checking the outcome, because there WAS no doubt. 

I imagine there is <i>still</i> no doubt really. Except that the Priestess can no longer ask alone. 

[Notes 5:47] 

It was originally “sister” not “Priestess.”

TIB 4lah. A need implies lack, by definition. It involves the recognition, conscious or unconscious, (and at times, fortunately, superconscious) that you would be better off in a state which is somehow different from the one you are in. 

TIB 41ai. Until the Separation, which is a better term than the Fall, 87 
nothing was lacking. This meant that man had no needs at all. If he 

had not deprived himself, he would never have experienced them. 

T(51) -51 

TIB 4laj. After the Separation, needs became the most powerful 
source of motivation for human action. All behavior is essentially 
motivated by needs, but behavior itself is not a Divine attribute. The 
body is the mechanism for behavior. (Ask any behaviorist, and he's 
<i>right</i>, too.) 

TIB 4lak. You tell your own classes that nobody would bother even 
to get up and go from one place to another if he did not think he 
would somehow be better off. This is very true. 

TIB 4lal. Believing that he COULD be "better off" is the reason why 
man has the mechanism for behavior at his disposal. This is why the 
Bible says "By their DEEDS ye shall know them." 88 
TIB 41am. A man acts according to the particular hierarchy of needs 
he establishes for himself. His hierarchy, in turn, depends on his 
perception of what he <i>is</i>, that is, what he LACKS. This establishes his 
own rules for what he needs to know. 


87 Genesis 3:1-7 Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God 
had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, “You shall not eat of every tree of the 
garden'?” And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the 
fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, “You shall not eat it, nor shall you 
touch it, lest you die.” Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. For God knows 
that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and 
evil.” So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a 
tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and 
he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they 
sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings. 

88 Matthew 7:16- 20 “By their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of 
thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree 
that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Therefore by their fruits ye shall 
know them.”

TIB 4lan. Separation from God is the only lack he really needs to 
correct. But his Separation would never have occurred if he had not 
distorted his perception of truth, and thus perceived himself as lacking. 

TIB 41 ao. The concept of ANY sort of need HIERARCHY arose because, having made this fundamental error, he had already fragmented himself into levels with DIFFERENT needs. As he integrates, HE becomes one, and his <i>one</i> need becomes one accordingly. Only the fragmented can be confused about this. 

TIB 41ap. Internal integration within the self will not (suffice to?) 
correct the lack fallacy, but it WILL correct the NEED fallacy. (Thank 
you for writing this as given.) Unified need produces unified action, 
because it produces lack of ambivalence. 

TIB 41aq. The concept of need hierarchy, a corollary to the original 
error, requires correction at its OWN level, before the error of levels 
itself can be corrected. Man cannot operate (or behave) effectively 
while he operates at split levels. But as long as he does so, he must 
introduce correction from the bottom UP. T(52) -52 

TIB 4lar. This is because he now operates in space, where "up" and 
"down" are meaningful terms. Ultimately, of course, space is as 
meaningless as time. The concept is really one of space-time BELIEF. 
The physical world exists only because man can use it to correct his 
UNBELIEF, which placed him in it originally. As long as man 
KNEW he did not need anything, the whole device was unnecessary. 

TIB 41as. The need to know is not safely under man's control at this 
time. It is MUCH better off under mine. Let's just leave it at that. 

TIB 41 at. (Specific question raised by WT re sex under existing conditions) (HS raised previous question about the past, which has just 
been answered.) 

TIB 41 au. The other question, however, I am more than willing to 
answer, because it is appropriate for NOW. You and B. both chose 


1-50

Chapter 1 - Introduction to Miracles 


your present sex partners shamefully, and would have to atone for 
the lack of love which was involved in any case. 

TIB 4lav. You selected them precisely <i>because</i> they were <i>not</i> 
suited to gratify your fantasies. This was not because you wanted to 
abandon or give up the fantasies, but because you were AFRAID of 
them. You saw in your partners a means of protecting against the 
fear, but both of you continued to "look around" for chances to indulge the fantasies. 

TIB 41aw. The dream of the "perfect partner" is an attempt to find 
EXTERNAL integration, while retaining conflicting needs in the self. 

TIB 4lax. B. was somewhat less guilty of this than you, but largely 
because he was more afraid. He had abandoned the hope (of finding 
a perfect partner) in a neurotic sense of despair of finding it. You, on 
the other hand, insisted that the hope was justified. Neither of you, 
therefore, was in your Right Mind. 

TIB 4lay. As was said before, homosexuality is INHERENTLY more 
risky (or error prone) than heterosexuality, but both can be undertaken on an equally false basis. The falseness of the basis is clear in 
the accompanying fantasies. Homosexuality <i>always</i> involves 
misperception of the self OR the partner, and generally both. T(53) -53 
TIB 4laz. Penetration <i>does</i> <i>not</i> involve magic, nor <i>does</i> ANY 
form of sexual behavior. It <i>is</i> a magic belief to engage in ANY form 
of body image activity at all. You neither created yourselves, nor 
controlled your creation. By introducing levels into your own perception, you opened the way for body-image distortions. 

TIB 4lba. The lack of love (or faulty need-orientation) which led to 
your particular person (not OBJECT) choices <i>can</i> BE corrected 
within the existent framework, and would <i>have</i> to be in the larger 
interest of overall progress. The situation is questionable largely because of its inherent vulnerability to fantasy-gratification. Doing the 
best you can WITHIN this limitation is probably the best corrective 
measure at present. Any relationship you have undertaken for 
whatever reasons becomes a responsibility.

TIB 41bb. If you shift your own needs, some amount of corresponding shift in the need-orientation of the other person <i>must</i> result. 
This will be beneficial, even if the partner was originally attracted to 
you <i>because</i> of your disrespect. Teaching devices which are totally alien to a learner's perceptual system are usually merely disruptive. Transfer depends on <i>some</i> common elements in the new 
situation which are understandable in terms of the old. 

TIB 4lbc. Man can never control the effects of fear himself, because 
he has CREATED fear and believes in what he creates. In attitude, 
then, though not in content, he resembles his own Creator, who has 
perfect faith in His Creations because he Created them. All creation 
rests on belief, and the belief in the creation produces its existence. 
This is why it is possible for a man to believe what is not true for 
anyone else. It is true for him because it is made BY him. 

TIB 41bd. Every aspect of fear proceeds from upside down perception. The TRULY creative devote their efforts to correcting this. The 
neurotic devotes his to compromise. The psychotic tries to escape by 
establishing the truth of his own errors. It is most difficult to free 
him by ordinary means, only because he is more stable in his denial 
of truth. T(54) -54 

TIB 42a. The miracle makes no distinction among degrees of misperception. It is a device for perception-correction which is effective 
quite apart from either the degree or the direction of the error. This 
is its TRUE indiscriminateness. 

TIB 42b. Christ-controlled miracles are selective only in that they 
are directed toward those who can use them for THEMSELVES. 
Since this makes it inevitable that they will extend them to others, a 
very strong chain of Atonement is welded. But Christ-control takes 
no account at all of the MAGNITUDE of the miracle itself, because 
the concept of size exists only in a plane that is itself unreal. Since 
the miracle aims at RESTORING reality, it would hardly be useful if 
it were bound by the laws of the same error it aims to correct. Only 
man makes that kind of error. It is an example of the "foolish consistency" his own false beliefs have engendered.

Chapter 1 - Introduction to Miracles 


TIB 42c. Both the power and the strength of man's creative will 
must be understood, before the real meaning of denial can be appreciated and abolished. Denial is <i>not</i> mere negation. It is a positive 
miscreation. While the miscreation is NECESSARILY believed in by 
its own creator, it does not exist at all at the level of true Creation. 
TIB 43a. The miracle compares the creations of man with the higher 
level of creation, accepting what is in ACCORD as true, and rejecting the DISCORDANT as false. This is why it is so closely associated 
with validity. Real validity is both true <i>and</i> useful, or better, it is 
useful <i>because</i> it is true. 

TIB 43b. All aspects of fear are untrue, because they <i>do not</i> exist 
at the higher creative levels, and therefore do not exist at all. To 
whatever extent a man is willing to submit his beliefs to the real test 

of validity, to that extent are his perceptions healed (or corrected.) 
T(55) -55 

TIB 43c. In sorting out the false from the true, the miracle proceeds 
much along the lines suggested very correctly by B., that is: 

If-perfect love casts out fear , 89 
And if fear exists, 

Then there is <i>not</i> perfect love. 

But 

Only perfect love really exists. 

TIB 43d. Therefore, if there is fear, it creates a state which does not 
exist. Believe THIS and you WILL be free. Only God can establish 
this solution, for THIS faith <i>is</i> His gift. 90 

TIC. Distortions of Miracle Impulses (Notes 211 5:60) 

T 1 c 1. Man must contribute to his readiness here as elsewhere. The 
readiness for faith, as for everything else that is true, entails the two 
steps necessary for the release from fear. 

89 1 John 4:18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. 
But he who fears has not been made perfect in love. 

90 Ephesians 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the 
gift of God,

T l c 2. Denial of fear, in human terms, is a strong defense because it 
entails two levels of error: 

1. That truth <i>can</i> be denied and 

2. That absence of truth can be effective. 

T l c 3. EXPERIENCING fear, which is more characteristic of B., involves only the second error. However, these differences do not affect the power of the miracle at all, since only truth and error are its 
concern. 

T l c 4. <i>you</i> are both more miracle-minded, and less able to recognise fear because of your stronger, but split, identification. B., also 
characteristically, is less miracle-minded, but better able to recognise fear, because his identification is more consistently right but 
weaker. 

T 1 C 5. Together, the conditions needed for consistent miracle- 
mindedness, the state in which fear has been abolished, can be particularly well worked out. In fact, it WAS already well worked out 
before. T(56) -56 

T l c 6. Your idea about the real meaning of "possession" should be 
clarified. Your own denial of fear (this refers to a visionary experience of HS) introduced some error variance, but not really a significant amount. However, there is always a chance that as the size of 
the sample increases, what was non-significant before may ATTAIN 
significance, so we had better get this out of the way now while you 
are still within the safety margin. 

T l c 7. Fear of possession is a perverted expression of the fear of the 
irresistible attraction. (Aside. Yes, this <i>does</i> apply to homosexuality, among other errors, where the whole concept of possessing, or 
"entering" is a key fear. It is a symbolic statement of an inverted decision <i>not</i> to enter into, or possess, the Kingdom. In physical 
terms, which it emphasizes because of the inherent error of Soul 
avoidance, <i>real</i> physical creation is avoided, and fantasy gratification is substituted.) 


1-54

Chapter 1 - Introduction to Miracles 


T 1 C 8. The truth is still that the attraction of God is irresistible at 
<i>all</i> levels, and the acceptance of this totally unavoidable truth is 
only a matter of time. But you should consider whether you <i>want</i> 
to wait, because you <i>can</i> return now, if you choose. (Note to HS: 
You are writing this with improper motivation, but we will try 
anyway. If you are to stop, do so immediately.) 

T 1 c 9. Possession is a concept which has been subject to numerous 
distortions, some of which we will list below: T(57) -57 

1. It (possession) can be associated with the body only. If this occurs, 
sex is particularly likely to be contaminated. Possession versus being 
possessed is apt to be seen as the male and female role. Since neither 
will be conceived of as satisfying alone, and both will be associated 
with fear, this interpretation is particularly vulnerable to psycho- 
sexual confusion. 

2. From a rather similar misperceptual reference point, possession 
can also be associated with things. This is essentially a shift from 1), 
and is usually due to an underlying fear of associating possession 
with people. In this sense, it is an attempt to PROTECT people, like 
the superstition about "protecting the name", we mentioned before. 

T 1 c 10. Both l) and 2) are likely to become compulsive for several 
reasons, including: 

a. They represent an attempt to escape from the real possession- 
drive, which cannot be satisfied this way. 

b. They set up substitute goals, which are usually reasonably easy to 
attain. 

c. They APPEAR to be relatively harmless, and thus SEEM to allay 
fear. The fact that they usually interfere with good interpersonal relationships can be interpreted, in this culture, as a lack of sophistication on the part of the OTHER (not the self), and this induces a false 
feeling of confidence in the solution, based on reliability <i>not</i> validity. It is also fairly easy to find a partner who SHARES the illusion. 
Thus, we have any number of relationships which are actually ES- 


65 


1-55 


Volume I Text 


TABLISHED on the basisT(58) -58 of l), and others which HOLD TOGETHER primarily because of the joint interests in 2). 
d. The manifestly EXTERNAL emphasis which both entail seems to 
be a safety device, and thus permits a false escape from much more 
basic inhibitions. As a compromise solution, the ILLUSION of interpersonal relating is preserved, along with the retention of the lack of 
love component. This kind of psychic juggling leaves the person (or 
juggler?) with a feeling of emptiness, which in fact is perfectly justified, because he <i>is</i> acting from scarcity. He then becomes more and 
more driven in his behavior, to fill the emptiness. 

T l c 11. When these solutions have been invested with extreme belief, l) leads to sex crimes, and 2) to stealing. The kleptomaniac is a 
good example of the latter. 

T l c 12. Generally, two types of emotional disturbances result: 

a. The tendency to maintain the illusion that only the physical is 
real. This produces depression. 

b. The tendency to invest the physical with non-physical properties. 
This is essentially magic, and tends more toward anxiety-proneness. 

c. The tendency to vacillate from one to the other, which produces a 
corresponding vacillation between depression <i>and</i> anxiety. 

T 1 C 13. Both result in self imposed starvation. 91 
T l c 14. 3. Another type of distortion is seen in the fear of or desire 
for "spirit" possession. The term "spirit" is profoundly debased in 
this context, but it <i>does</i> entail a recognition that T(59) -59 the body is 
not enough, and investing it with magic will not work. This recognition ACCEPTS the fact that neither 1) nor 2) is sufficient, but, precisely <i>because</i> it does not limit fear so narrowly, it is more likely 
to produce greater fear in its own right. 

91 It is odd that it says “two things happen” and then lists three and then describes all three as “both.” 
But that is the form in the Notes. This material is not preserved in any other version available to us. 
However, there are actually two, A) and B) with C) being a mix of the two which could be considered a 
third.

Chapter 1 - Introduction to Miracles 


T 1 C 15. Endowing the Spirit with human possessiveness is a more 
INCLUSIVE error than 1) or 2), and a step somewhat further away 
from the "Right Mind." Projection is also more likely to occur, with 
vacillations between grandiosity and fear. "Religion" in a distorted 
sense, is also more likely to occur in this kind of error, because the 
idea of a "spirit" is introduced, though fallaciously, while it is excluded from 1) and 2). 

T 1 c 16. Witchcraft is thus particularly apt to be associated with 3), 
because of the much greater investment in magic. 

T 1 C 17. It should be noted that 1) involves only the body, and 2) involves an attempt to associate things with human attributes. Three, 
on the other hand, is a more serious level confusion, because it endows the Spirit with EVIL attributes. This accounts both for the religious zeal of its proponents, and the aversion (or fear) of its opponents. Both attitudes stem from the same false belief. 

T 1 c 18. This is <i>not</i> what the Bible means by "possessed of the Holy 
Spirit." It is interesting to note that even those who DID understand 
that could nevertheless EXPRESS their understanding inappropriately. The concept of "speaking T(60) -60 in many tongues" was originally an injunction to communicate to everyone in his own language, or his own level. It hardly meant to speak in a way that NOBODY can understand. This strange error occurs when people <i>do</i> 
understand the need for Universal communication, but have contaminated it with possession fallacies. The fear engendered by this 
misperception leads to a conflicted state in which communication <i>is</i> 
attempted, but the fear is allayed by making the communication incomprehensible . 

T 1 c 19. It could also be said that the fear induced selfishness, or regression, because incomprehensible communication is hardly a worthy offering from one Son of God to another. 

T 1 c 20. 4. Knowledge can also be misinterpreted as a means of possession. Here, the content is not physical, and the underlying fallacy 
is more likely to be the confusion of mind and brain. The attempt to 
unite non-physical content with physical attributes is illustrated by 


67 


1-57 


Volume I Text 


statements like "the thirst for knowledge." (No Helen, this is <i>not</i> 
what the "thirst" in the Bible means. The term was used only because of man's limited comprehension, and is probably better 
dropped.) 

T l c 21. The fallacious use of knowledge can result in several errors, 
including: 

a. The idea that knowledge will make the individual more attractive 
to others. This is a possession-fallacy. 

b. The idea that knowledge will make the individual invulnerable. 
This is the reäction formation against the underlying fear of vulnerability. T(61) -61 

c. The idea that knowledge will make the individual worthy. This is 
largely pathetic. 

T l c 22. Both you and B. should consider type 4) <i>very</i> carefully. 

Like all these fallacies, it contains a denial mechanism, which swings 
into operation as the fear increases, thus cancelling out the error 
temporarily, but seriously impairing efficiency. 

T 1 C 23. Thus, you claim you can’t read, and B. claims that he can’t 
speak. Note that depression is a real risk here, for a Child of God 
should never REDUCE his efficiency in ANY way. The depression 
comes from a peculiar pseudo-solution which reads: 

A Child of God is efficient. 

I am not efficient. 

Therefore, I am not a Child of God. 

T 1 C 24. This leads to neurotic resignation, and this is a state which 
merely INCREASES the depression. 

T 1 C 25. The 92 corresponding denial mechanism for 1) is the sense of 
PHYSICAL inability, or IMPOTENCE. The denial mechanism for 2) 
is often bankruptcy. Collectors of things often drive themselves well 


92 {(Ed. Note) The following paragraph shows up and is crossed out, and is repeated on Urtext page 69

beyond their financial means, in an attempt to force discontinuance. 
If this idea of cessation cannot be tolerated, a strange compromise 
involving BOTH insatiable possessiveness and insatiable throwing- 
away (bankruptcy) may result. An example is the inveterate or 
compulsive gambler, particularly the horse-racing addict. Here, the 
conflicted drive is displaced both from people <i>and</i> things, and is 
invested in animals. The implied DEROGATION of people is the 
cause of the underlying EXTREME superstition of the horse racing 
addict. T(62) -62
