  You will see miracles through your hands through me.
</blockquote>

<p class="principle">
  1. The first principle of miracles is that there is no order of difficulty among them.
  One is not ‘harder’ or ‘bigger’ than another. They are all the same.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  2. Miracles in themselves do not matter; they are quite unimportant. 
</p>

<p class="principle">
  3. Miracles occur naturally as expressions of love. 
  The real miracle is the love that inspires them. 
  In this sense, everything that comes from love is a miracle.
</p>

<p>This explains their lack of order. 
  <em>All</em> expressions of love are maximal. 
  This also explains why miracles in themselves do not matter. 
  The only thing that matters is the source, and this is far beyond human evaluation.
</p>

<p>
  Please read these three principles as often as you can today, as if there were going to be a quiz this evening. 
  This is merely to introduce structure, if it is needed. 
  It is <em>not</em> to frighten you. 
  <em>Do not</em> feel guilty if you are doubting these principles. 
  Just reread them and their truth will come to you. 
  <em>My</em> strength will support you, so don’t worry and leave the rest to me. 
</p>

<p>
  <em>All</em> miracles mean life, and God is the giver of life. 
  He will direct you <em>very</em> specifically. 
  ‘<em>Plan ahead</em>’ is good advice in this world, where you should and must control and direct where you have accepted responsibility. 
  But the universal plan is in more appropriate hands. 
  You will know all you need to know. 
  Make <em>no</em> attempts to plan ahead in this respect.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  4. Miracles are habits and should be involuntary. 
  Otherwise they may become undemocratic. 
  Selective miracles are dangerous, and may destroy the talent.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  5. Miracles are natural. 
  When they do <em>not</em> occur something has gone wrong.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  6. Miracles are everyone’s right, but purification is necessary first.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-3" id="fn-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a>
</p>

<p class="principle">
  7. Miracles are a form of healing. 
  They supply a lack, and are performed by those who have more for those who have less.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  8. Miracles are a kind of exchange. 
  Like all expressions of love, which are <em>always</em> miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses physical laws.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  9. A miracle is a reversal of the physical order because it brings more love to the <em>giver</em> and the receiver.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  10. The use of miracles as a spectacle to induce belief is wrong. 
  They are really used for and by believers. 
  A miracle is misunderstood when it is regarded as a spectacle.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  11. Prayer is the medium of miracles. 
  Prayer is the natural communication between the created and the Creator. 
  Through prayer love is received, and through miracles love is expressed.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  12. Miracles are the effects of thought. 
  Thought can make the lower order or create the higher order. 
  This is the basic distinction between intellectualising and true thinking. 
  One makes the physical, and the other creates the spiritual. 
  And we believe in what we make or create.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  13. A miracle is a beginning and an ending. 
  It thus abolishes time. 
  It is always an affirmation of rebirth, which seems to go back but really goes forward. 
  It undoes the past in the present, and thus releases the future.
</p>

<p>
  Yet there may still be one more thing: your fear of punishment for what is done <em>now</em>. 
  Everybody makes mistakes. 
  These errors are completely trivial. 
  When the past has been forgiven, these minor infractions are very easily altered.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  14. All miracles attest to truth. 
  They are convincing because they arise from conviction. 
  Without conviction, they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless and therefore destructive, or rather, the 
  uncreative use of mind.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  15. Each day should be devoted to miracles. 
  Time was made so you could use it creatively, and convince himself of your own ability to create. 
  Time is a teaching device, and a means to an end. 
  It will cease when it is no longer useful for facilitating learning.
</p>

<p>
  Have a good day. 
  Since only eternity is real, why not use the illusion of time constructively? 
  You might remember that “underneath are the everlasting arms”.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-4" id="fn-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> 
  You should begin each day with the prayer, “Help me to perform whatever miracles you want of me today”.
</p>

<p>
  Notes on this course should be read only under good learning conditions. 
  They should also be reviewed. 
  I’ll tell you when, but <em>remember to ask</em>. 
</p>

<p class="principle">
  16. Miracles are teaching devices for demonstrating that it is as blessed to give as to receive.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-5" id="fn-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a>
  They simultaneously increase the reserve of strength in the giver and supply the lack of strength in the receiver.
</p>

<p>
  I have forgiven you and that means all hurt and hate you have ever expressed is cancelled. 
  I need the children of light now. 
  You who live so close to God must not give way to guilt. 
  The karmic law demands abandonment for abandoning, but you have received mercy, not ‘justice’. 
  Help the children because you love them and love God. 
  Remember, a miracle is a spark of life. 
  It shines through the darkness and brings in the light.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-6" id="fn-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> 
  You must begin to forget and remember.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  17. Miracles are the absence of the body. 
  They are sudden shifts into invisibility, away from the physical level. 
  That is why they heal.
</p>

<p class="principle">
  18. A miracle is a service. 
  It is the maximal service one person can render another. 
  It is a way of loving your neighbor as yourself.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#fn-7" id="fn-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a> 
  The doer recognises his own and his neighbour’s inestimable value simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
  This is why you cannot keep anything you hold against another. 
  If you do, your own value is no longer inestimable,  because you are estimating it as infinity minus that amount.
</p>
