<h2>I. The Last Step</h2>

<p>
  The creative power of God and His creations is limitless, but they are not in reciprocal relationship.
  You communicate fully with God, as He does with you.
  This is an ongoing process in which you share, and because you share it, you are inspired to create like God.
  Yet in creation you are not in a reciprocal relation to God, since He created you but you did not create Him.
  I have already told you that only in this respect your creative power differs from His.
  Even in this world there is a parallel.
  Parents give birth to children, but children do not give birth to parents.
  They do, however, give birth to their children, and thus give birth as their parents do.
</p>

<p>
  If you created God and He created you, the Kingdom could not increase through its own creative thought.
  Creation would therefore be limited, and you would not be cocreator with God.
  As God’s creative Thought proceeds from Him to you, so must your creative thought proceed from you to your creations.
  Only in this way can all creative power extend outward.
  God’s accomplishments are not yours, but yours are like His.
  He created the Sonship and you increase it.
  You have the power to add to the Kingdom, though not to add to the Creator of the Kingdom.
  You claim this power when you become vigilant only for God and His Kingdom.
  By accepting this power as yours you have learned to remember what you are.
</p>

<p>
  Your creations belong in you, as you belong in God.
  You are part of God, as your sons are part of His Sons.
  To create is to love.
  Love extends outward simply because it cannot be contained.
  Being limitless it does not stop.
  It creates forever, but not in time.
  God’s creations have always been, because He has always been.
  Your creations have always been, because you can create only as God creates.
  Eternity is yours, because He created you eternal.
</p>

<p>
  The ego, on the other hand, always demands reciprocal rights, because it is competitive rather than loving.
  It is always willing to strike a bargain, but it cannot understand that to be like another means that no bargains are possible.
  To gain you must give, not bargain.
  To bargain is to limit giving, and this is not God's Will.
  To will with God is to create like Him.
  God does not limit His gifts in any way.
  You <em>are</em> His gifts, and so your gifts must be like His.
  Your gifts to the Kingdom must be like His gifts to you.
</p>

<p>
  I gave only love to the Kingdom because I believed that was what I was.
  What you believe you are determines your gifts, and if God created you by extending Himself as you, you can only extend yourself as He did.
  Only joy increases forever, since joy and eternity are inseparable.
  God extends outward beyond limits and beyond time, and you who are cocreator with Him extend His Kingdom forever and beyond limit.
  Eternity is the indelible stamp of creation.
  The eternal are in peace and joy forever.
</p>

<p>
  To think like God is to share His certainty of what you are, and to create like Him is to share the perfect Love He shares with you.
  To this the Holy Spirit leads you, that your joy may be complete because the Kingdom of God is whole.
  I have said that the last step in the reäwakening of knowledge is taken by God.
  This is true, but it is hard to explain in words because words are symbols, and nothing that is true need be explained.
  However, the Holy Spirit has the task of translating the useless into the useful, the meaningless into the meaningful, and the temporary into the timeless.
  He can therefore tell you something about this last step.
</p>

<p>
  God does not take steps, because His accomplishments are not gradual.
  He does not teach, because His creations are changeless.
  He does nothing last, because He created first and for always.
  It must be understood that the word <q>first</q> as applied to Him is not a time concept.
  He is first in the sense that He is the First in the Holy Trinity Itself.
  He is the Prime Creator, because He created His cocreators.
  Because He did, time applies neither to Him nor to what He created.
  The <q>last step</q> that God will take was therefore true in the beginning, is true now, and will be true forever.
  What is timeless is always there, because its being is eternally changeless.
  It does not change by increase, because it was forever created to increase.
  If you perceive it as not increasing you do not know what it is.
  You also do not know Who created it.
  God does not reveal this to you because it was never hidden.
  His light was never obscured, because it is His Will to share it.
  How can what is fully shared be withheld and then revealed?
</p>

<h2>II. The Law of the Kingdom</h2>

<p>
  To heal is the only kind of thinking in this world that resembles the Thought of God, and because of the elements they share, can transfer easily to it.
  When a brother perceives himself as sick, he is perceiving himself as not whole, and therefore in need.
  If you, too, see him this way, you are seeing him as if he were absent from the Kingdom or separated from it, thus making the Kingdom itself obscure to both of you.
  Sickness and separation are not of God, but the Kingdom is.
  If you obscure the Kingdom, you are perceiving what is not of God.
</p>

<p>
  To heal, then, is to correct perception in your brother and yourself by sharing the Holy Spirit with him.
  This places you both within the Kingdom, and restores its wholeness in your mind.
  This reflects creation, because it unifies by increasing and integrates by extending.
  What you project or extend is real for you.
  This is an immutable law of the mind in this world as well as in the Kingdom.
  However, the content is different in this world, because the thoughts it governs are very different from the Thoughts in the Kingdom.
  Laws must be adapted to circumstances if they are to maintain order.
  The outstanding characteristic of the laws of mind as they operate in this world is that by obeying them, and I assure you that you must obey them, you can arrive at diametrically opposed results.
  This is because the laws have been adapted to the circumstances of this world, in which diametrically opposed outcomes seem possible because you can respond to two conflicting voices.
</p>

<p>
  Outside the Kingdom, the law that prevails inside is adapted to <q>What you project you believe</q>.
  This is its teaching form, because outside the Kingdom learning is essential.
  This form implies that you will learn what you are from what you have projected onto others, and therefore believe they are.
  In the Kingdom there is no teaching or learning, because there is no belief.
  There is only certainty.
  God and His Sons, in the surety of being, know that what you extend you are.
  That form of the law is not adapted at all, being the law of creation.
  God Himself created the law by creating <em>by</em> it.
  And His Sons, who create like Him, follow it gladly, knowing that the increase of the Kingdom depends on it, just as their own creation did.
</p>

<p>
  Laws must be communicated if they are to be helpful.
  In effect, they must be translated for those who speak different languages.
  Nevertheless, a good translator, although he must alter the form of what he translates, never changes the meaning.
  In fact, his whole purpose is to change the form so that the original meaning is retained.
  The Holy Spirit is the Translator of the laws of God to those who do not understand them.
  You could not do this yourself because a conflicted mind cannot be faithful to one meaning, and will therefore change the meaning to preserve the form.
</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit’s purpose in translating is exactly the opposite.
  He translates only to preserve the original meaning in all respects and in all languages.
  Therefore, He opposes the idea that differences in form are meaningful, emphasising always that <em>these differences do not matter</em>.
  The meaning of His message is always the same: only the meaning matters.
  God’s law of creation does not involve the use of truth to convince His Sons of truth.
  The extension of truth, which <em>is</em> the law of the Kingdom, rests only on the knowledge of what truth is.
  This is your inheritance and requires no learning at all, but when you disinherited yourself you became a learner of necessity.
</p>

<p>
  No one questions the connection of learning and memory.
  Learning is impossible without memory since it must be consistent to be remembered.
  That is why the Holy Spirit’s teaching is a lesson in remembering.
  I said before that He teaches remembering and forgetting, but the forgetting is only to make the remembering consistent.
  You forget in order to remember better.
  You will not understand His translations while you listen to two ways of interpreting them.
  Therefore you must forget or relinquish one to understand the other.
  This is the only way you can learn consistency, so that you can finally <em>be</em> consistent.
</p>

<p>
  What can the perfect consistency of the Kingdom mean to those who are confused?
  It is apparent that confusion interferes with meaning, and therefore prevents the learner from appreciating it.
  There is no confusion in the Kingdom, because there is only one meaning.
  This meaning comes from God and <em>is</em> God.
  Because it is also you, you share it and extend it as your Creator did.
  This needs no translation because it is perfectly understood, but it does need extension because it <em>means</em> extension.
  Communication is perfectly direct and perfectly united.
  It is totally free, because nothing discordant ever enters.
  That is why it is the Kingdom of God.
  It belongs to Him and is therefore like Him.
  That is its reality, and nothing can assail it.
</p>

<h2>III. The Reality of the Kingdom</h2>


<p>
  The Holy Spirit teaches one lesson, and applies it to all individuals in all situations.
  Being conflict-free, He maximises all efforts and all results.
  By teaching the power of the Kingdom of God Himself, He teaches you that all power is yours.
  Its application does not matter.
  It is always maximal.
  Your vigilance does not establish it as yours, but it does enable you to use it always and in all ways.
  When I said <q>I am with you always</q>, I meant it literally.
  I am not absent to anyone in any situation.
  Because I am always with you, <em>you</em> are the way, the truth and the life.
  You did not make this power, any more than I did.
  It was created to be shared, and therefore cannot be meaningfully perceived as belonging to anyone at the expense of another.
  Such a perception makes it meaningless by eliminating or overlooking its real and only meaning.
</p>

<p>
  God’s meaning waits in the Kingdom, because that is where He placed it.
  It does not wait in time.
  It merely rests in the Kingdom because it belongs there, as you do.
  How can you who are God’s meaning perceive yourself as absent from it?
  You can see yourself as separated from your meaning only by experiencing yourself as unreal.
  This is why the ego is insane: it teaches that you are not what you are.
  That is so contradictory it is clearly impossible.
  It is therefore a lesson you cannot really learn, and therefore cannot really teach.
  Yet you are always teaching.
  You must, therefore, be teaching something else, even though the ego does not know what it is.
  The ego, then, is always being undone, and does suspect your motives.
  Your mind cannot be unified in allegiance to the ego, because the mind does not belong to it.
  Yet what is <q>treacherous</q> to the ego is faithful to peace.
  The ego’s <q>enemy</q> is therefore your friend.
</p>

<p>
  I said before that the ego’s friend is not part of you, because the ego perceives itself at war and therefore in need of allies.
  You who are not at war must look for brothers and recognise all whom you see as brothers, because only equals are at peace.
  Because God’s equal Sons have everything, they cannot compete.
  Yet if they perceive any of their brothers as anything other than their perfect equals, the idea of competition has entered their minds.
  Do not underestimate your need to be vigilant <em>against</em> this idea, because all your conflicts come from it.
  It <em>is</em> the belief that conflicting interests are possible, and therefore you have accepted the impossible as true.
  Is that different from saying you perceive yourself as unreal?
</p>

<p>
  To be in the Kingdom is merely to focus your full attention on it.
  As long as you believe you can attend to what is not true, you are accepting conflict as your choice.
  Is it really a choice?
  It seems to be, but seeming and reality are hardly the same.
  You who <em>are</em> the Kingdom are not concerned with seeming.
  Reality is yours because you are reality.
  This is how <em>having</em> and <em>being</em> are ultimately reconciled, not in the Kingdom, but in your mind.
  The altar there is the only reality.
  The altar is perfectly clear in thought, because it is a reflection of perfect Thought.
  Your right mind sees only brothers, because it sees only in its own light.
</p>

<p>
  God has lit your mind Himself, and keeps your mind lit by His light because His light is what your mind is.
  This is totally beyond question, and when you question it you are answered.
  The Answer merely undoes the question by establishing the fact that to question reality is to question meaninglessly.
  That is why the Holy Spirit never questions.
  His sole function is to undo the questionable and thus lead to certainty.
  The certain are perfectly calm, because they are not in doubt.
  They do not raise questions, because nothing questionable enters their minds.
  This holds them in perfect serenity, because this is what they share, knowing what they are.
</p>

<h2>IV. Healing as the Recognition of Truth</h2>

<p>
  Truth can only <em>be</em> recognised and <em>need</em> only be recognised.
  Inspiration is of the Holy Spirit, and certainty is of God according to His laws.
  Both, therefore, come from the same Source, since inspiration comes from the Voice for God and certainty comes from the laws of God.
  Healing does not come directly from God, Who knows His creations as perfectly whole.
  Yet healing is still of God, because it proceeds from His Voice and from His laws.
  It is their result, in a state of mind that does not know Him.
  The state is unknown to Him and therefore does not exist, but those who sleep are unaware.
  Because they are unaware, they do not know.
</p>

<p>
  The Holy Spirit must work <em>through</em> you to teach you He is <em>in</em> you.
  This is an intermediary step toward the knowledge that you are in God because you are part of Him.
  The miracles the Holy Spirit inspires can have no order of difficulty, because every part of creation is of one order.
  This is God’s Will and yours.
  The laws of God establish this, and the Holy Spirit reminds you of it.
  When you heal, you are remembering the laws of God and forgetting the laws of the ego.
  I said before that forgetting is merely a way of remembering better.
  It is therefore not the opposite of remembering when it is properly perceived.
  Perceived improperly, it induces a perception of conflict with something else, as all incorrect perception does.
  Properly perceived, it can be used as a way out of conflict, as all proper perception can.
</p>

<p>
  The ego does not want to teach everyone all it has learned, because that would defeat its purpose.
  Therefore it does not really learn at all.
  The Holy Spirit teaches you to use what the ego has made, to teach the opposite of what the ego has <q>learned</q>.
  The kind of learning is as irrelevant as is the particular ability that was applied to the learning.
  All you need do is make the effort to learn, for the Holy Spirit has a unified goal for the effort.
  If different abilities are applied long enough to one goal, the abilities themselves become unified.
  This is because they are channelised in one direction, or in one way.
  Ultimately, then, they all contribute to one result, and by so doing, their similarity rather than their differences is emphasised.
</p>

<p>
  All abilities should therefore be given over to the Holy Spirit, Who understands how to use them properly.
  He uses them only for healing, because He knows you only as whole.
  By healing you learn of wholeness, and by learning of wholeness you learn to remember God.
  You have forgotten Him, but the Holy Spirit understands that your forgetting must be translated into a way of remembering.
</p>

<p>
  The ego’s goal is as unified as the Holy Spirit’s, and it is because of this that their goals can never be reconciled in any way or to any extent.
  The ego always seeks to divide and separate.
  The Holy Spirit always seeks to unify and heal.
  As you heal you are healed, because the Holy Spirit sees no order of difficulty in healing.
  Healing is the way to undo the belief in differences, being the only way of perceiving the Sonship as one.
  This perception is therefore in accord with the laws of God, even in a state of mind that is out of accord with His.
  The strength of right perception is so great that it brings the mind into accord with His, because it serves His Voice, which is in all of you.
</p>

<p>To think you can oppose the Will of God is a real delusion.
  The ego believes that it can, and that it can offer you its own <q>will</q> as a gift.
  <em>You do not want it</em>.
  It is not a gift.
  It is nothing at all.
  God has given you a gift that you both <em>have</em> and <em>are</em>.
  When you do not use it, you forget that you have it.
  By not remembering it, you do not know what you are.
  Healing, then, is a way of approaching knowledge by thinking in accordance with the laws of God, and recognising their universality.
  Without this recognition, you have made the laws meaningless to you.
  Yet the laws are not meaningless, since all meaning is contained by them and in them.
</p>

<p>
  Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven, because that is where the laws of God operate truly, and they can operate only truly because they are the laws of truth.
  But seek this only, because you can find nothing else.
  There <em>is</em> nothing else.
  God is All in all in a very literal sense.
  All being is in Him Who is all Being.
  You are therefore in Him since your being is His.
  Healing is a way of forgetting the sense of danger the ego has induced in you, by not recognising its existence in your brother.
  This strengthens the Holy Spirit in both of you, because it is a refusal to acknowledge fear.
  Love needs only this invitation.
  It comes freely to all the Sonship, being what the Sonship is.
  By your awakening to it, you are merely forgetting what you are not.
  This enables you to remember what you are.
</p>

<h2>V. Healing and the Changelessness of Mind</h2>

<p>
  The body is nothing more than a framework for developing abilities, which is quite apart from what they are used for.
  <em>That</em> is a decision.
  The effects of the ego’s decision in this matter are so apparent that they need no elaboration, but the Holy Spirit’s decision to use the body only for communication has such a direct connection with healing that it does need clarification.
  The unhealed healer obviously does not understand his own vocation.
</p>

<p>
  Only minds communicate.
  Since the ego cannot obliterate the impulse to communicate because it is also the impulse to create, it can only teach you that the body can both communicate and create, and therefore does not need the mind.
  The ego thus tries to teach you that the body can act like the mind, and is therefore self-sufficient.
  Yet we have learned that behaviour is not the level for either teaching or learning, since you can act in accordance with what you do not believe.
  To do this, however, will weaken you as a teacher and a learner because, as has been repeatedly emphasised, you teach what you <em>do</em> believe.
  An inconsistent lesson will be poorly taught and poorly learned.
  If you teach both sickness <em>and</em> healing, you are both a poor teacher and a poor learner.
</p>

<p>
  Healing is the one ability everyone can develop and must develop if he is to be healed.
  Healing is the Holy Spirit's form of communication in this world, and the only one He accepts.
  He recognises no other, because He does not accept the ego’s confusion of mind and body.
  Minds can communicate, but they cannot hurt.
  The body in the service of the ego can hurt other bodies, but this cannot occur unless the body has already been confused with the mind.
  This situation, too, can be used either for healing or for magic, but you must remember that magic always involves the belief that healing is harmful.
  This belief is its totally insane premise, and so it proceeds accordingly.
</p>

<p>
  Healing only strengthens.
  Magic always tries to weaken.
  Healing perceives nothing in the healer that everyone else does not share with him.
  Magic always sees something <q>special</q> in the healer, which he believes he can offer as a gift to someone who does not have it.
  He may believe that the gift comes from God to him, but it is quite evident that he does not understand God if he thinks he has something that others lack.
</p>

<p>
  The Holy Spirit does not work by chance, and healing that is of Him <em>always</em> works.
  Unless the healer always heals by Him the results will vary.
  Yet healing itself is consistent, since only consistency is conflict-free, and only the conflict-free are whole.
  By accepting exceptions and acknowledging that he can sometimes heal and sometimes not, the healer is obviously accepting inconsistency.
  He is therefore in conflict, and is teaching conflict.
  Can anything of God not be for all and for always?
  Love is incapable of any exceptions.
  Only if there is fear does the idea of exceptions seem to be meaningful.
  Exceptions are fearful because they are made by fear.
  The <q>fearful healer</q> is a contradiction in terms, and is therefore a concept that only a conflicted mind could possibly perceive as meaningful.
</p>

<p>
  Fear does not gladden.
  Healing does.
  Fear always makes exceptions.
  Healing never does.
  Fear produces dissociation, because it induces separation.
  Healing always produces harmony, because it proceeds from integration.
  It is predictable because it can be counted on.
  Everything that is of God can be counted on, because everything of God is wholly real.
  Healing can be counted on because it is inspired by His Voice, and is in accord with His laws.
  Yet if healing is consistent it cannot be inconsistently understood.
  Understanding means consistency because God means consistency.
  Since that is His meaning, it is also yours.
  Your meaning cannot be out of accord with His, because your whole meaning and your only meaning comes from His and is like His.
  God cannot be out of accord with Himself, and you cannot be out of accord with Him.
  You cannot separate your Self from your Creator, Who created you by sharing His Being with you.
</p>

<p>
  The unhealed healer wants gratitude from his brothers, but he is not grateful to them.
  That is because he thinks he is giving something to them, and is not receiving something equally desirable in return.
  His teaching is limited because he is learning so little.
  His healing lesson is limited by his own ingratitude, which is a lesson in sickness.
  True learning is constant, and so vital in its power for change that a Son of God can recognise his power in one instant and change the world in the next.
  That is because, by changing his mind, he has changed the most powerful device that was ever given him for change.
  This in no way contradicts the changelessness of mind as God created it, but you think that you have changed it as long as you learn through the ego.
  This places you in a position of needing to learn a lesson that seems contradictory: you must learn to change your mind about your mind.
  Only by this can you learn that it <em>is</em> changeless.
</p>

<p>
  When you heal, that is exactly what you <em>are</em> learning.
  You are recognising the changeless mind in your brother by realising that he could not have changed his mind.
  That is how you perceive the Holy Spirit in him.
  It is only the Holy Spirit in him that never changes His Mind.
  He himself may think he can, or he would not perceive himself as sick.
  He therefore does not know what his Self is.
  If you see only the changeless in him you have not really changed him.
  By changing your mind about his <em>for</em> him, you help him undo the change his ego thinks it has made in him.
</p>

<p>
  As you can hear two voices, so you can see in two ways.
  One way shows you an image, or an idol that you may worship out of fear, but will never love.
  The other shows you only truth, which you will love because you will understand it.
  Understanding is appreciation, because what you understand you can identify with, and by making it part of you, you have accepted it with love.
  That is how God Himself created you; in understanding, in appreciation and in love.
  The ego is totally unable to understand this, because it does not understand what it makes, does not appreciate it and does not love it.
  It incorporates to take away.
  It literally believes that every time it deprives someone of something, it has increased.
  I have spoken often of the increase of the Kingdom by your creations, which can only be created as you were.
  The whole glory and perfect joy that <em>is</em> the Kingdom lies in you to give.
  Do you not want to give it?
</p>

<p>
  You cannot forget the Father because I am with you, and I cannot forget Him.
  To forget me is to forget yourself and Him Who created you.
  Our brothers are forgetful.
  That is why they need your remembrance of me and of Him Who created me.
  Through this remembrance, you can change their minds about themselves, as I can change yours.
  Your mind is so powerful a light that you can look into theirs and enlighten them, as I can enlighten yours.
  I do not want to share my body in communion because this is to share nothing.
  Would I try to share an illusion with the most holy children of a most holy Father?
  Yet I do want to share my mind with you because we are of one Mind, and that Mind is ours.
  See only this Mind everywhere, because only this is everywhere and in everything.
  It is everything because it encompasses all things within itself.
  Blessed are you who perceive only this, because you perceive only what is true.
</p>

<p>
  Come therefore unto me, and learn of the truth in you.
  The mind we share is shared by all our brothers, and as we see them truly they will be healed.
  Let your mind shine with mine upon their minds, and by our gratitude to them make them aware of the light in them.
  This light will shine back upon you and on the whole Sonship, because this is your proper gift to God.
  He will accept it and give it to the Sonship, because it is acceptable to Him and therefore to His Sons.
  This is true communion with the Holy Spirit, Who sees the altar of God in everyone, and by bringing it to your appreciation, He calls upon you to love God and His creation.
  You can appreciate the Sonship only as one.
  This is part of the law of creation, and therefore governs all thought.
</p>

<h2>VI. From Vigilance to Peace</h2>

<p>
  Although you can love the Sonship only as one, you can perceive it as fragmented. 
  It is impossible, however, to see something in part of it that you will not attribute to all of it. 
  That is why attack is never discrete, and why it must be relinquished entirely. 
  If it is not relinquished entirely it is not relinquished at all. 
  Fear and love make or create, depending on whether the ego or the Holy Spirit begets or inspires them, but they <em>will</em> return to the mind of the thinker and they will affect his total perception. 
  That includes his concept of God, of His creations and of his own. 
  He will not appreciate any of Them if he regards Them fearfully. 
  He will appreciate all of Them if he regards Them with love.
</p>

<p>
  The mind that accepts attack cannot love. 
  That is because it believes it can destroy love, and therefore does not understand what love is. 
  If it does not understand what love is, it cannot perceive itself as loving. 
  This loses the awareness of being, induces feelings of unreality and results in utter confusion. 
  Your thinking has done this because of its power, but your thinking can also save you from this because its power is not of your making. 
  Your ability to direct your thinking as you choose is part of its power. 
  If you do not believe you can do this you have denied the power of your thought, and thus rendered it powerless in your belief.
</p>

<p>
  The ingeniousness of the ego to preserve itself is enormous, but it stems from the very power of the mind the ego denies. 
  This means that the ego attacks what is preserving it, which must result in extreme anxiety. 
  That is why the ego never recognises what it is doing. 
  It is perfectly logical but clearly insane. 
  The ego draws upon the one source that is totally inimical to its existence <em>for</em> its existence. 
  Fearful of perceiving the power of this source, it is forced to depreciate it. 
  This threatens its own existence, a state which it finds intolerable. 
  Remaining logical but still insane, the ego resolves this completely insane dilemma in a completely insane way. 
  It does not perceive <em>its</em> existence as threatened by projecting the threat onto <em>you</em>, and perceiving your being as nonexistent. 
  This ensures its continuance if you side with it, by guaranteeing that you will not know your own safety.
</p>

<p>
  The ego cannot afford to know anything. 
  Knowledge is total, and the ego does not believe in totality. 
  This unbelief is its origin, and while the ego does not love you it <em>is</em> faithful to its own antecedents, begetting as it was begotten. 
  Mind always reproduces as it was produced. 
  Produced by fear, the ego reproduces fear. 
  This is its allegiance, and this allegiance makes it treacherous to love because you <em>are</em> love. 
  Love is your power, which the ego must deny. 
  It must also deny everything this power gives you <em>because</em> it gives you everything. 
  No one who has everything wants the ego. 
  Its own maker, then, does not want it. 
  Rejection is therefore the only decision the ego could possibly encounter, if the mind that made it knew itself. 
  And if it recognised any part of the Sonship, it <em>would</em> know itself.
</p>

<p>
  The ego therefore opposes all appreciation, all recognition, all sane perception and all knowledge. 
  It perceives their threat as total, because it senses that all commitments the mind makes are total. 
  Forced, therefore, to detach itself from you, it is willing to attach itself to anything else. 
  But there <em>is</em> nothing else. 
  The mind can, however, make up illusions, and if it does so it will believe in them, because that is how it made them.
</p>

<p>
  The Holy Spirit undoes illusions without attacking them, because He cannot perceive them at all. 
  They therefore do not exist for Him. 
  He resolves the apparent conflict they engender by perceiving conflict as meaningless. 
  I have said before that the Holy Spirit perceives the conflict exactly as it is, and it <em>is</em> meaningless. 
  The Holy Spirit does not want you to understand conflict; He wants you to realise that, because conflict is meaningless, it is not understandable. 
  As I have already said, understanding brings appreciation and appreciation brings love. 
  Nothing else can be understood, because nothing else is real and therefore nothing else has meaning.
</p>

<p>
  If you will keep in mind what the Holy Spirit offers you, you cannot be vigilant for anything <em>but</em> God and His Kingdom. 
  The only reason you may find this hard to accept is because you may still think there is something else. 
  Belief does not require vigilance unless it is conflicted. 
  If it is, there are conflicting components within it that have led to a state of war, and vigilance has therefore become essential. 
  Vigilance has no place in peace. 
  It is necessary against beliefs that are not true, and would never have been called upon by the Holy Spirit if you had not believed the untrue. 
  When you believe something, you have made it true for you. 
  When you believe what God does not know, your thought seems to contradict His, and this makes it appear as if you are attacking Him.
</p>

<p>
  I have repeatedly emphasised that the ego does believe it can attack God, and tries to persuade you that you have done this. 
  If the mind cannot attack, the ego proceeds perfectly logically to the belief that you must be a body. 
  By not seeing you as you are, it can see itself as it wants to be. 
  Aware of its weakness the ego wants your allegiance, but not as you really are. 
  The ego therefore wants to engage your mind in its own delusional system, because otherwise the light of your understanding would dispel it. 
  It wants no part of truth, because the ego itself is not true. 
  If truth is total, the untrue cannot exist. 
  Commitment to either must be total; they cannot coëxist in your mind without splitting it. 
  If they cannot coëxist in peace, and if you want peace, you must give up the idea of conflict entirely and for all time. 
  This requires vigilance only as long as you do not recognise what is true. 
  While you believe that two totally contradictory thought systems share truth, your need for vigilance is apparent.
</p>

<p>
  Your mind is dividing its allegiance between two kingdoms, and you are totally committed to neither. 
  Your identification with the Kingdom is totally beyond question except by you, when you are thinking insanely. 
  What you are is not established by your perception, and is not influenced by it at all. 
  Perceived problems in identification at any level are not problems of fact. 
  They are problems of understanding, since their presence implies a belief that what you are is up to you to decide. 
  The ego believes this totally, being fully committed to it. 
  It is not true. 
  The ego therefore is totally committed to untruth, perceiving in total contradiction to the Holy Spirit and to the knowledge of God.
</p>

<p>
  You can be perceived with meaning only by the Holy Spirit because your being <em>is</em> the knowledge of God. 
  Any belief you accept apart from this will obscure God’s Voice in you, and will therefore obscure God to you. 
  Unless you perceive His creation truly you cannot know the Creator, since God and His creation are not separate. 
  The Oneness of the Creator and the creation is your wholeness, your sanity and your limitless power. 
  This limitless power is God’s gift to you, because it is what you are. 
  If you dissociate your mind from it you are perceiving the most powerful force in the universe as if it were weak, because you do not believe you are part of it.
</p>

<p>
  Perceived without your part in it, God’s creation is seen as weak, and those who see themselves as weakened do attack. 
  The attack must be blind, however, because there is nothing to attack. 
  Therefore they make up images, perceive them as unworthy and attack them for their unworthiness. 
  That is all the world of the ego is. 
  Nothing. 
  It has no meaning. 
  It does not exist. 
  Do not try to understand it because, if you do, you are believing that it can be understood and is therefore capable of being appreciated and loved. 
  That would justify its existence, which cannot be justified. 
  You cannot make the meaningless meaningful. 
  This can only be an insane attempt.
</p>

<p>
  Allowing insanity to enter your mind means that you have not judged sanity as wholly desirable. 
  If you want something else you will make something else, but because it is something else, it will attack your thought system and divide your allegiance. 
  You cannot create in this divided state, and you must be vigilant against this divided state because only peace can be extended. 
  Your divided mind is blocking the extension of the Kingdom, and its extension is your joy. 
  If you do not extend the Kingdom, you are not thinking with your Creator and creating as He created.
</p>

<p>
  In this depressing state the Holy Spirit reminds you gently that you are sad because you are not fulfilling your function as cocreator with God, and are therefore depriving yourself of joy. 
  This is not God’s choice but yours. 
  If your mind could be out of accord with God’s, you would be willing without meaning. 
  Yet because God’s Will is unchangeable, no conflict of will is possible. 
  This is the Holy Spirit’s perfectly consistent teaching. 
  Creation, not separation, is your will <em>because</em> it is God’s, and nothing that opposes this means anything at all. 
  Being a perfect accomplishment, the Sonship can only accomplish perfectly, extending the joy in which it was created, and identifying itself with both its Creator and its creations, knowing They are One.
