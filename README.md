# acim-ebook

I'm editing the ur-text to make an ebook of a course in miracles.

I'm using my preferred language conventions.

I'm going to borrow chapter and section titles from COA's edition.

I don't mind if COA decide I've borrowed too much from them and shut me down.

I'm also doing a separate treatment of the FPI edition where I've tried to explicate the language of the course.
